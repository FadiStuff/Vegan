# Argument 110: "Biology proves humans are meant to eat meat."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
“Natural” doesn’t mean moral—biology doesn’t justify harm.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Humans are omnivores, but biology shows we thrive on plants.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Our adaptability means we can choose a compassionate, healthy diet.

## Ethical Response

Pointing to biology to justify eating meat ignores the moral dimension of choice. Humans are capable of eating many things, but that doesn’t make every choice ethical. We don’t use “nature” to justify other harmful behaviors—so why use it here?

Veganism isn’t about denying biology; it’s about using our intelligence and empathy to live in a way that causes less harm. The ability to eat meat doesn’t create a moral obligation to do so.

Being “meant to” do something is different from choosing what’s right.

## Factual Response

Humans are opportunistic omnivores, meaning we can survive on many diets. Our teeth, digestion, and physiology show adaptability, not a requirement for meat. In fact, our long intestines and blunt teeth resemble herbivores more than carnivores.

Modern nutrition science confirms that humans don’t need meat to thrive. Plant-based diets meet all nutrient requirements with planning, and some nutrients (like fiber and antioxidants) are only found in plants.

Biology shows we’re flexible—not dependent on meat.

## Practical Response

Our adaptability gives us freedom to choose a compassionate diet. With supplements like B12 and fortified foods, we can get all essential nutrients without animal products. Millions of vegans worldwide are proof that biology doesn’t limit us.

If anything, our intelligence and technology free us from relying on animal exploitation. We can thrive while doing less harm, and that’s progress.

Biology is a starting point, not a moral rulebook.
