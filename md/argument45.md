# Argument 45: "God gave us animals to eat."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even if ancient texts permitted eating animals, that doesn’t make it moral today. Ethics evolve—and compassion should lead the way.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Religious texts have been used to justify many harmful practices throughout history. That doesn’t mean we should continue them today. Most religions also teach compassion, mercy, and stewardship.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You don’t have to reject your faith to live in alignment with its deeper values. Many believers choose veganism as a more peaceful, consistent path.

## Ethical Response

Even if your religion teaches that humans once had divine permission to eat animals, we should ask: **Is it still the right thing to do now?** 

Morality evolves. We’ve used scripture to justify slavery, misogyny, and violence—none of which are acceptable today. The fact that something was once allowed doesn’t mean it’s eternally ethical.

If animals are sentient, if they feel fear and pain, and if we can live well without harming them—what’s the compassionate choice?

No matter what a book says, we have free will. And we can choose kindness.

## Factual Response

The claim that “God gave us animals to eat” often comes from a specific reading of religious texts—usually the Old Testament or Quran. But interpretations vary widely across cultures, sects, and time.

Some scholars argue that the earliest passages (like Genesis 1:29) actually promote plant-based diets. Others note that meat-eating only enters the narrative after acts of violence or divine punishment.

More importantly, nearly all major religions also emphasize:
- Mercy
- Nonviolence
- Stewardship of the Earth
- Respect for life

So if we’re cherry-picking doctrine, let’s prioritize the parts that ask us to protect the vulnerable—not consume them.

## Practical Response

You don’t have to renounce your religion to go vegan. In fact, many people embrace veganism *because* of their spiritual beliefs—not in spite of them.

There are Christian vegans, Jewish vegans, Muslim vegans, Hindu vegans, Buddhist vegans. They view plant-based living as a deeper expression of their faith’s call to mercy, justice, and care for creation.

Maybe God gave us animals—but that doesn’t mean we have to take them. We have a choice. And choosing not to harm when we don’t have to? That sounds like grace in action.
