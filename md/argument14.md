# Argument 14: "Vegans kill animals too—look at crop harvesting"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Minimizing harm isn’t the same as eliminating it. Accidental deaths from crop farming are tragic—but intentionally breeding, confining, and killing animals is far worse.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Eating plants directly uses fewer resources and kills fewer animals overall. Skipping the middleman—the livestock—reduces unintended wildlife deaths from crop farming.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Animal agriculture causes far more crop deaths than vegan diets, because most crops are fed to livestock. Veganism reduces total harm—to plants, animals, and ecosystems.

## Ethical Response
It’s true that crop farming can unintentionally harm animals—field mice, insects, birds. But the key word is **unintentional**. There’s a massive ethical difference between regrettable collateral damage and deliberately breeding animals into existence just to kill them.

Saying “vegans kill animals too” is like saying, “You can’t be against car crashes if you drive.” No system is perfect—but that doesn’t mean all systems are equally harmful. Animal agriculture kills far more animals directly *and* indirectly, due to the huge amount of crops grown to feed livestock. By skipping the middleman (the animal), veganism reduces total death—plants and animals alike.

## Practical Response
If the goal is to reduce overall harm, a plant-based diet still wins. Why? Because more crops are used to feed animals than to feed vegans. It takes around 10 pounds of plants to produce 1 pound of meat. That means more land, more pesticides, and yes—more unintended wildlife deaths.

So even if crop farming kills some field mice, the most practical way to reduce that number is to eat plants *directly*, not feed them to livestock first. Veganism minimizes the damage.

## Factual Response
Scientific estimates show that producing plant-based food causes fewer animal deaths overall than producing meat. For example, beef requires 28x more land and 11x more water than common crops. Animal agriculture is also responsible for far more ecosystem destruction—which displaces and kills wildlife on a massive scale.

While no diet is cruelty-free, a well-planned vegan diet remains the most effective way to minimize harm. Swapping steak for soy might not save every insect—but it sure saves a lot more lives than business as usual.
