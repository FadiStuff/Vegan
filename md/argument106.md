# Argument 106: "Nutrition advice keeps changing, so why trust it?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Evolving science isn’t a reason to ignore evidence; it’s a reason to refine choices.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Core nutrition principles—like eating more plants—have stayed consistent.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Focus on long-term trends, not diet fads, to make informed choices.

## Ethical Response

It’s true that nutrition headlines often seem contradictory. One week eggs are bad, the next week they’re fine. But this doesn’t mean science is unreliable; it means science is working as intended, constantly improving its understanding. Ignoring evidence because it evolves is like refusing medical treatment because technology advances—it doesn’t make sense.

Choosing veganism isn’t about chasing trends; it’s about aligning your eating habits with compassion and the best available science. The fact that science evolves should reassure us that our choices are based on a process that corrects itself over time.

Progress doesn’t mean we should ignore what we know now. It means making informed choices while staying open to future knowledge.

## Factual Response

Despite changing headlines, the fundamentals of nutrition haven’t changed much: eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes; limit processed foods; and reduce saturated fat. A plant-based diet aligns perfectly with these principles, which have been consistent for decades.

What changes most are details—specific nutrient targets, the health effects of particular foods, or the interpretation of studies. The overall recommendation to center diets around plants has remained solid, backed by major health organizations worldwide.

Nutrition science isn’t as volatile as the news makes it seem.

## Practical Response

To avoid confusion, focus on consensus, not headlines. The world’s largest health organizations, including the American Dietetic Association and the World Health Organization, agree that well-planned vegan diets are safe and healthy for all ages. That’s not a fad; that’s consensus.

Plant-based eating isn’t about following every new study; it’s about embracing a dietary pattern that’s consistently supported by evidence and cultural traditions. Choose stable, science-backed habits rather than chasing trends.

Science evolves, but the case for eating more plants has only grown stronger.
