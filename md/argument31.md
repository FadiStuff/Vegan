# Argument 31: "It’s just the circle of life."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
“Circle of life” doesn’t mean moral free-for-all. Lions kill to survive. We kill for taste. Big difference.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Using “circle of life” to justify eating animals ignores our ability to choose better. You’re not a wild predator.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Nature isn’t an ethical guidebook. Animals kill to survive; humans no longer need to. Biology ≠ morality.

## Ethical Response

Invoking the “circle of life” sounds deep—but it’s often used to excuse unnecessary harm. Yes, life involves death. But we’re not talking about ecosystems—we’re talking about choices in a supermarket.

Lions kill because they must. Humans kill because they want bacon. That’s not the circle of life—that’s the cycle of convenience.

Morality isn’t about what’s natural. It’s about what’s avoidable.

## Practical Response

You’re not living in the wild. You have options—grocery stores, tofu, oat milk, frozen veggie burgers. Claiming “circle of life” while ordering DoorDash isn’t practical—it’s avoidance.

Practical living today means using our resources to reduce harm. “Because nature” is not a get-out-of-ethics-free card.

If we can break the cycle of killing and still thrive, why wouldn’t we?

## Factual Response

In nature, animals do what they must. But humans have evolved reason, empathy, and agriculture. We no longer need to hunt to survive.

Appealing to nature is a logical fallacy. Just because something is “natural” doesn’t make it good. Disease, violence, and parasites are also natural.

Factually, our place in the food chain is flexible. And we have the power to choose compassion.
