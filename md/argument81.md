# Argument 81: "If animals weren’t meant to be eaten, they wouldn’t be made of meat."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Being edible doesn’t make killing moral.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Many edible things are off-limits; morality isn’t about biology.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
We can eat animals, but we don’t have to—and shouldn’t.

## Ethical Response

This argument boils down to “we can, so we should.” Just because something is edible doesn’t mean it’s moral to eat it. Humans are also made of meat, but no one argues that makes cannibalism ethical. Being physically capable of harming another being has never been a justification for doing it.

Animals are living individuals with interests and emotions, not just objects made of flesh. Reducing them to “meat” is a way to distance ourselves from their suffering. Ethical choices aren’t determined by convenience or biology; they’re determined by empathy and responsibility. We don’t have to kill animals to survive, so doing so is a choice—not a necessity.

Veganism challenges the idea that physical characteristics justify exploitation. Morality requires us to look beyond what’s easy or possible and consider what’s right. Being edible doesn’t make an animal’s life less valuable.

We have the ability to do better, and that’s what matters most.

## Factual Response

Many things are technically edible but not acceptable to eat: endangered animals, pets, or humans. The fact that something is biologically consumable has nothing to do with ethics. Historically, humans have eaten all kinds of things out of necessity, but our dietary options have expanded dramatically.

Modern science shows that humans don’t need animal products to thrive. A well-planned vegan diet meets all nutritional needs. Framing animals as “meat” is a linguistic trick, not a logical argument for killing them.

Our ability to process food biologically doesn’t give moral permission to kill. It simply means humans are omnivorous and adaptable. Today, that adaptability allows us to choose compassion.

Eating animals is a cultural habit, not a biological imperative.

## Practical Response

This argument ignores that we have alternatives. Grocery stores are full of plant-based proteins, dairy alternatives, and fortified foods. Veganism is easier now than at any time in history. Saying “animals are meat” doesn’t address the ethical reality or the abundance of cruelty-free choices.

We can use our intelligence to make decisions that reflect our values. If eating animals feels morally questionable, we don’t have to rationalize it—we can stop. Convenience is no longer a justification for cruelty.

The future of food will likely move even further away from animal exploitation. Lab-grown meat, plant-based alternatives, and sustainable crops prove we’re capable of choosing kindness over tradition. “They’re made of meat” is not an argument for continuing harm; it’s a reminder of how casually we view sentient life.
