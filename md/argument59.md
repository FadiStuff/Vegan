# Argument 59: "Kids need animal products to grow properly."

## TL;DRs

Major dietetic associations confirm that vegan diets are safe and adequate for all life stages, including childhood.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
With balanced meals and attention to key nutrients, plant-based kids grow strong, healthy, and energetic.

## Ethical Response

The idea that children *must* eat animal products treats animals as expendable “growth fuel.” But kids don’t need to harm others to be healthy.

We have the knowledge and resources to nourish children entirely on plants, ensuring they develop physically and mentally without supporting cruelty.

If we can raise compassionate, healthy kids without taking lives, that’s the ethical choice.

## Factual Response

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the British Dietetic Association, and other health authorities state that well-planned vegan diets are suitable for all ages.

Plant-based kids can get protein, calcium, iron, omega-3s, and vitamins from legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits, and fortified foods. B12 supplementation is essential, but so is it for many adults.

Studies show vegan children can have normal growth patterns, healthy weights, and strong bones when diets are balanced.

## Practical Response

Feeding vegan kids isn’t complicated—just offer a variety of whole plant foods, and ensure reliable sources of B12, vitamin D, and omega-3s.

Breakfast: fortified oatmeal with soy milk and berries. Lunch: lentil soup with whole grain bread. Dinner: tofu stir-fry with brown rice and veggies. Snacks: fruit, hummus with carrots, or nut butter on toast.

With thoughtful planning, kids can grow healthy bodies *and* compassionate hearts.
