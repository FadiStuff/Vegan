# Argument 33: "But other animals eat other animals."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Lions also kill their young and eat feces. Nature isn’t a moral guide. We can choose compassion—even if other animals can’t.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Carnivores kill to survive. Humans have other options. Our biology and behavior are not the same.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Just because other animals do something doesn’t mean we should. You’re not a lion. You have a stove, a conscience, and oat milk.

## Ethical Response

Saying “other animals do it” is a moral cop-out. Lions also kill cubs, mate by force, and don’t floss. Should we imitate that too?

Animals act on instinct. They don’t have the capacity for moral reasoning, social justice, or ethical debate. You do. That’s the whole point. Our ability to reflect, empathize, and make better choices is what makes us human.

Being able to dominate doesn’t mean we should. The ethical question isn’t “what do others do?”—it’s “what should *I* do, knowing what I know and having the choices I have?”

## Factual Response

Yes, some animals eat other animals. But not all do—and humans don’t have to. Physiologically, we’re omnivores, not obligate carnivores. We have flat molars, long intestines, and zero biological need for meat if adequate nutrition is available.

Predators in the wild kill because they must. They lack moral agency, supermarkets, or tofu. We, on the other hand, thrive on plant-based diets, backed by every major nutrition body in the world.

It’s not a fair comparison. Lions survive by killing. We kill out of preference. That’s a world of difference.

## Practical Response

Let’s be real: no one’s modeling their life after a hyena or a polar bear. You’re not pouncing on antelope for breakfast. You’re ordering lunch on an app.

We live in cities, not savannahs. We have laws, ethics, and Chickpea TikTok. Just because a wild animal eats meat doesn’t mean a modern human should. Other animals also don’t wear clothes, brush their teeth, or file taxes. You’re not copying them there.

So why use them to justify killing when better options are right in front of you?
