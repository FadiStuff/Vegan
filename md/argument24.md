# Argument 24: "Lions and other animals eat meat—it’s natural."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Lions act on instinct. We act on values. Morality doesn’t come from predators—it comes from compassion and choice.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Lions are obligate carnivores. Humans are not. That’s a biological fact, not a philosophical excuse.

**Practical TL;DR:**
You’re not a lion. You have oat milk, veggie burgers, and DoorDash. “Natural” doesn’t mean necessary.

## Ethical Response

Lions also kill their young, eat feces, and mate by force. Are those behaviors we want to copy?

Humans are moral agents. We don’t base our ethics on what wild animals do—we base them on our ability to choose the least harmful path. Lions *must* eat meat to survive. We don’t. That difference matters.

Doing what’s “natural” doesn’t make it right. We left the food chain when we invented refrigerators and grocery stores.

## Practical Response

Practically speaking, invoking nature is just an excuse. You live in a built environment. You don’t hunt with your teeth. You don’t raise and kill your food personally. You shop.

What lions do in the Serengeti has no bearing on what you do at Whole Foods. “Natural” doesn’t equal practical—or moral.

You have choices. Use them.

## Factual Response

Lions are obligate carnivores. Their physiology requires meat. They lack the ability to digest plant-based nutrients effectively. Their teeth, claws, and digestion systems are built for predation.

Humans? We’re omnivores. We *can* eat meat—but we *don’t have to*. Major nutrition bodies agree that a well-planned vegan diet is perfectly healthy.

Citing lions to justify meat-eating is bad science. You’re not a lion—and science proves it.
