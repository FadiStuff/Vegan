# Argument 100: "Plant-based alternatives are just as bad for the environment and economy."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Plant-based options aren’t perfect but are far less harmful than animal products.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Research shows plant-based foods use fewer resources than meat and dairy.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Supporting better systems is progress, even if they’re not perfect.

## Ethical Response

Critics often point out that almond milk or Beyond Burgers have their own environmental costs, implying veganism isn’t a solution. It’s true that no food system is completely impact-free, but the scale matters. Animal agriculture is the single largest driver of deforestation and habitat loss worldwide. Comparing it to plant-based alternatives is misleading; one causes harm at an industrial scale, while the other is a fraction of that.

Veganism isn’t about perfection—it’s about harm reduction. Choosing plant-based products over animal products is always a step in the right direction, even if those alternatives aren’t perfect.

## Factual Response

Studies consistently show that plant-based foods have far lower greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water use than animal-based foods. For example, producing a liter of cow’s milk requires three times as much land and water as almond milk. Plant-based meats like Beyond or Impossible Burgers use up to 90% less land and water and emit far fewer greenhouse gases.

The economic argument often ignores subsidies. Animal agriculture receives billions in support, making meat artificially cheap. If those subsidies shifted to plant-based industries, the economic balance would look very different.

Plant-based alternatives aren’t perfect, but they’re a massive improvement over livestock farming.

## Practical Response

Veganism doesn’t require eating processed alternatives. Beans, lentils, vegetables, grains, and fruits are low-cost, nutrient-dense, and environmentally friendly. Processed plant-based products are just tools to help people transition.

Supporting companies that innovate with sustainable practices is progress. As demand for plant-based products grows, companies will have incentives to lower their environmental footprint even further.

Perfection isn’t the goal—reducing harm is. Every plant-based swap is a win for the planet and the economy.
