# Argument 83: "Farm animals are bred for food, so it’s fine to eat them."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Breeding animals for exploitation doesn’t justify harming them.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Purpose is assigned by humans, not nature; animals still have interests.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
We can stop breeding animals for harm entirely.

## Ethical Response

This argument assumes that assigning a purpose to a being makes harm acceptable. By that logic, breeding animals for entertainment, research, or labor would justify cruelty too. Creating life for exploitation doesn’t erase the moral obligation to treat that life with respect.

Animals are not objects or tools; they’re sentient individuals. Their interests exist regardless of human plans. A cow doesn’t consent to being food simply because we bred her that way. Exploitation by design is still exploitation.

History is full of practices justified by “purpose”—slavery, child labor, or forced marriage. Assigning roles to individuals to excuse harm is ethically flawed. Veganism challenges this mindset by recognizing animals as beings with their own intrinsic value.

Breeding animals for food isn’t a justification; it’s part of the problem.

## Factual Response

Farm animals are selectively bred for traits humans find profitable, like fast growth or high milk yield. This selective breeding often harms their health, causing joint problems, reproductive issues, and short lifespans. The fact that humans designed them for agriculture doesn’t mean exploitation is morally neutral.

Science shows that pigs, cows, chickens, and other farm animals are intelligent and capable of complex emotions. Assigning them a “purpose” doesn’t change their sentience. A pig bred for food still experiences fear and pain like a dog.

The idea of breeding as moral justification collapses when applied elsewhere. Breeding a dog for racing doesn’t make cruelty okay. The same logic applies to cows, chickens, and pigs.

## Practical Response

If humans can breed animals for exploitation, we can stop breeding them too. The shift toward plant-based diets is already reducing demand for livestock farming. By choosing veganism, we help reduce the number of animals born into suffering.

Purpose is a human concept, not a moral permission slip. Redesigning food systems to rely on plants instead of animals is practical, sustainable, and compassionate.

Breeding animals for harm is a choice. Choosing not to is just as simple, and far more ethical.
