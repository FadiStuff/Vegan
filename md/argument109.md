## Ethical Response

It’s true that corporations influence science, and some studies are biased. But dismissing all nutrition science because of this is like refusing all medicine because some companies profit from it. Ethical decisions should be based on the best available evidence, not cynicism.

Veganism is supported by research from independent scientists, universities, and public health agencies worldwide. Choosing kindness doesn’t depend on trusting a single corporation; it’s about weighing the full body of evidence.

Critical thinking is good, but total distrust serves industries that benefit from inaction.

## Factual Response

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the gold standard of research—consistently show that plant-based diets lower chronic disease risk and environmental impact. These studies are conducted by universities, nonprofits, and global health agencies, not just corporations.

While food companies do fund some studies, independent research overwhelmingly supports eating more plants. Skepticism should lead us to better evidence, not to dismiss it entirely.

Nutrition science is robust when you look at the full picture, not just sensational headlines.

## Practical Response

To avoid bias, rely on trusted sources like the World Health Organization, the American Heart Association, or Cochrane Reviews. Independent watchdogs and peer review processes exist to catch flawed research.

Consumers can hold companies accountable and support transparent science. Being informed means learning how to evaluate evidence, not abandoning it.

Veganism is one of the most evidence-backed lifestyle choices you can make.
