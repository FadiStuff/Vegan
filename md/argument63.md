# Argument 63: "There’s no B₁₂ in plants — it’s proof we need animal products."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
The absence of B₁₂ in plants doesn’t justify killing animals. We can get it directly from supplements—just like the animals you eat already do.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
B₁₂ is made by bacteria, not animals. Modern farm animals are routinely supplemented, meaning meat is just a secondhand source.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
A cheap, reliable B₁₂ supplement or fortified food covers your needs—no animals required.

## Ethical Response

This argument sounds like a nutritional checkmate: “Plants don’t have B₁₂, so we *need* animal products.” But it ignores how B₁₂ actually works.

B₁₂ is made by bacteria—not by plants or animals. In the past, humans got it naturally from soil and water, but modern sanitation (a good thing!) removed those sources.

Today, both humans *and* farm animals rely on supplementation. Most cows, chickens, and pigs raised for food don’t get B₁₂ naturally—they’re given it in their feed. Eating animals for B₁₂ means going through them as middlemen, causing harm in the process. Why harm an animal for something we can get directly and cruelty-free?

## Factual Response

Vitamin B₁₂ is essential for nerve health, DNA production, and red blood cell formation. Deficiency can cause fatigue, nerve damage, and cognitive issues. So yes—it’s important. But no—it doesn’t prove we need meat.

Animals don’t make B₁₂ themselves. They either ingest bacteria from their environment or, in modern farming, get B₁₂ supplements. That means most meat eaters are already relying on supplemented B₁₂—just indirectly.

Vegan sources are the same: fortified plant milks, cereals, nutritional yeast, or direct supplements. The nutrient is identical—without the cholesterol, saturated fat, or ethical cost.

## Practical Response

Getting B₁₂ as a vegan is simple, cheap, and effective. A small supplement once a day—or a higher dose once a week—meets your needs. Fortified foods make it even easier.

Compare that to eating animals for B₁₂: it’s slower, more expensive, and comes with health risks. And since those animals were probably supplemented anyway, you’re just taking the scenic route.

The bottom line? B₁₂ is important for everyone, vegan or not—but getting it directly is healthier, cleaner, and far kinder.
