# Argument 97: "Veganism will destroy rural communities and farmers’ livelihoods."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Protecting farmers matters, but cruelty-driven industries shouldn’t be permanent.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Farming can shift to sustainable plant-based production with support.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Policy and innovation can revitalize rural economies.

## Ethical Response

Farming is a proud tradition, and farmers deserve respect for their hard work. But the fact that livelihoods depend on an industry doesn’t make that industry ethical. Many harmful industries have been phased out over time as society’s values evolved. The goal isn’t to abandon farmers; it’s to support them in moving toward systems that don’t rely on cruelty.

Veganism advocates for both animals and humans. Farmers and rural workers should be part of the solution, not left behind. Transition programs and subsidies can help communities pivot toward plant-based crops or other industries. Compassion for animals doesn’t have to come at the expense of compassion for people.

The future of agriculture can be kinder for everyone involved.

## Factual Response

Studies show that animal agriculture is resource-intensive and environmentally destructive, while many plant crops are more profitable per acre. Programs already exist to help farmers transition from livestock to crops like oats, soy, and hemp. These changes aren’t hypothetical—they’re happening now.

Many rural economies are struggling under the weight of consolidation; large corporations dominate animal agriculture, and small farmers often face debt and low margins. Plant-based industries offer opportunities for independence and diversification. Farmers can earn more with less environmental impact by shifting away from livestock.

Rural communities won’t be destroyed by veganism; they’ll be revitalized with sustainable alternatives.

## Practical Response

Transition takes planning. Governments, nonprofits, and food companies can invest in farmers, offering training, grants, and infrastructure to help them succeed in new industries. Plant-based food production, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture are all growing sectors with high demand for skilled workers.

Supporting farmers through this transition ensures rural communities thrive. Instead of clinging to harmful systems, we can create a future where farmers are part of the solution, not left behind.

Economic justice and animal justice can go hand in hand.
