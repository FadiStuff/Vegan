# Argument 43: "Not all land is suitable for crops, only grazing."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Just because we *can* graze animals on marginal land doesn’t mean we *should*. Ethical food systems prioritize minimizing harm—not squeezing animals into every usable patch of dirt.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
It's true that some land isn't ideal for crops. But that doesn't mean raising animals there is environmentally efficient or necessary. Grazing still contributes to emissions, land degradation, and inefficiency.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
There are better ways to use marginal land—like rewilding, afforestation, or conservation. Grazing animals is not the only or best option.

## Ethical Response

This argument frames animals as tools—“if the land isn’t good for crops, let’s use it to grow cows instead.” But sentient beings aren’t gap fillers for awkward terrain.

Using every square meter of land for production, regardless of the impact on animals or ecosystems, reflects an outdated, exploitative mindset. Even if grazing is “efficient” on marginal land, that doesn’t justify breeding animals into existence only to kill them.

A truly ethical system would ask: “What causes the least harm?” Not “How can we use every inch of the Earth for profit?”

## Factual Response

Yes, some land is too arid, rocky, or mountainous for crop farming. But using that land for grazing doesn’t magically make animal agriculture sustainable.

Grazing animals still produces methane. It still requires water. It often leads to overgrazing, erosion, and biodiversity loss—especially in fragile ecosystems. And even in ideal conditions, grazing is still a highly inefficient way to produce calories and protein.

It’s not about whether we *can* graze animals—it’s about whether it’s the smartest, most sustainable use of land. In most cases, it’s not.

## Practical Response

Instead of defaulting to grazing, we could rewild marginal lands. Let them return to forests, wetlands, or native grasslands. These ecosystems absorb carbon, support biodiversity, and require no inputs.

We can also use such land for low-impact human use: hiking, conservation, or even solar and wind energy installations.

The idea that “if we don’t graze animals here, we waste the land” is a false dilemma. There are better options—ones that don’t involve more animals, more emissions, and more suffering.
