# Argument 36: "What if you were stranded on a desert island?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Survival scenarios don’t justify everyday choices. If you’re not stranded, don’t act like you are.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Being stuck on a desert island is not your reality. In the real world, we have abundant vegan options and no need to harm animals.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Sure, survive however you need to on a desert island. But that has nothing to do with how you eat at home, today, with a full fridge.

## Ethical Response

The desert island question imagines a world where survival trumps morality. And in that rare, hypothetical case, it might. But that’s not the world most of us live in.

If someone were truly stranded with no food but animals, survival instincts would kick in. That’s understandable. But the point of ethics is to guide our choices when we *do* have options. And in everyday life, we have plenty.

Veganism isn’t about extreme hypotheticals. It’s about reducing harm when we can. Most of us can—so we should.

## Factual Response

Let’s separate fantasy from fact. Desert island scenarios are not a reflection of real-world eating habits. They’re philosophical curveballs, not dietary realities.

In practice, most people have access to plant-based foods, grocery stores, and nutritional guidance. Vegan diets are supported by major health organizations and are fully adequate for all life stages.

So while it’s possible someone might need to eat animals to survive in extreme conditions, that has nothing to do with day-to-day choices made in modern society.

## Practical Response

If you were stranded with no food, of course you’d do what you had to do to survive. But that’s not the situation you’re in when you’re choosing between dairy milk and soy milk at the store.

We don’t base our moral standards on emergencies. We base them on what we do when we have options—and we have more options than ever. Plant-based diets are widely accessible, affordable, and increasingly normalized.

So sure, if you're ever shipwrecked, do what you must. But back here on the mainland? Veganism makes sense.
