# Argument 34: "Isn’t being vegetarian enough?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Vegetarianism reduces harm—but it still supports cruelty. The dairy and egg industries also kill, often brutally.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Cows and hens in vegetarian-friendly industries are still exploited, confined, and eventually slaughtered. Vegetarian isn’t cruelty-free.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you’re already vegetarian, you’ve done the hard part. Going vegan is just the next, easier, more consistent step.

## Ethical Response

Going vegetarian is a great start—but it’s not the finish line. The dairy and egg industries aren’t harmless alternatives. They’re often just as cruel—sometimes worse.

Female cows are forcibly impregnated, have their calves taken away, and are milked until they collapse. Male calves? Usually shot, chained, or sent to veal crates. Laying hens are crammed into cages, and male chicks—because they can’t lay eggs—are ground up alive or gassed on day one.

Vegetarianism reduces harm, but it still funds suffering. If your goal is compassion, veganism follows naturally.

## Factual Response

Many people think going vegetarian stops animal slaughter. It doesn’t—not entirely. Dairy cows and egg-laying hens are still killed when they’re no longer “productive.” And before that, they endure lives of confinement, mutilation, and exhaustion.

The dairy industry is closely linked to the veal industry. Eggs? Just as bad—billions of male chicks are killed every year because they don’t lay. These facts don’t vanish with a “vegetarian” label.

If you care about animal welfare, the facts point clearly to veganism—not just vegetarianism—as the consistent choice.

## Practical Response

Look, if you’re already vegetarian, you’ve done the hardest part: giving up meat. That’s huge. The next step—cutting out dairy and eggs—is easier than ever.

There are oat milks, almond yogurts, vegan butters, and egg replacers galore. From bakeries to burger joints, the world is going plant-based faster than a soy latte cools. You don’t have to sacrifice anything—just swap a few staples.

Being vegetarian is admirable. But if your ethics are already pointing you in that direction, why stop halfway?
