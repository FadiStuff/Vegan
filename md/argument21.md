# Argument 21: "Animals are treated well on small/local farms."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Nice treatment doesn’t justify unnecessary killing. Kindness before slaughter doesn’t make the act itself kind.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Local farms often use the same slaughterhouses and practices as industrial ones. And they can’t feed the world sustainably.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Small farms still slaughter animals. And research shows even “happy” animals resist death. Ethical treatment doesn’t erase this fact.

## Ethical Response

Small farms may provide more space, less confinement, and better treatment. But in the end, the animals still die—usually young, always without consent.

If someone raised a dog with love, then killed them at six months for a meal, we wouldn’t call that ethical. So why apply a double standard to cows, pigs, or chickens?

Moral consideration shouldn’t end where the barn door closes.

## Practical Response

Most small-scale farms still rely on slaughterhouses for killing—often the same ones used by large producers. Humane intentions meet brutal systems.

And scaling up local meat to feed the world would require even *more* land, water, and emissions. That’s not sustainable—it’s nostalgia in disguise.

Plant-based systems are more efficient and scalable. That’s the practical path forward.

## Factual Response

Even on the best farms, animals resist slaughter. Studies show they exhibit signs of stress, fear, and resistance—regardless of how they were raised.

Also, the line between “factory” and “family” farm isn’t clear. Many so-called small farms use industrial feed, antibiotics, and off-site slaughter.

Better conditions help—but they don’t solve the problem. The issue isn’t how nicely we kill—it’s whether we need to kill at all.
