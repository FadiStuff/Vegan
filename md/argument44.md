# Argument 44: "Meat is more calorie-dense and resource-efficient."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Efficiency doesn’t justify cruelty. Even if meat were more calorie-dense, it comes at the cost of immense suffering, environmental destruction, and wasted potential.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Meat might be calorie-dense, but it’s wildly inefficient. It takes multiple pounds of feed, gallons of water, and acres of land to produce a single pound of meat. Plants win by a landslide.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you want efficient nutrition, plants deliver more calories and protein per acre with fewer emissions, less waste, and no slaughter.

## Ethical Response

Framing meat as “efficient” ignores what’s being measured. Are we talking about calories—or the cost in suffering, resources, and lives?

Efficiency isn't just about inputs and outputs. It's about values. A system that breeds animals into existence, confines them, and slaughters them for food we don’t need is the opposite of ethical—no matter how many calories it contains.

We shouldn’t aim to optimize cruelty. We should aim to minimize it.

## Factual Response

Let’s break this down. Yes, meat is calorie-dense. But producing it is a colossal drain on resources.

To get one pound of beef, you need:
- ~7 pounds of grain
- ~1,800 gallons of water
- ~52 square feet of land

The conversion ratio from feed to meat is abysmal. You're growing tons of crops just to funnel them through an animal—losing energy at every step.

Compare that to beans, lentils, or potatoes, which grow directly and efficiently with far fewer inputs and a fraction of the emissions.

Calling meat “efficient” is like calling a Hummer efficient because it has a big gas tank.

## Practical Response

If you're looking for bang-for-your-buck nutrition, plants are hard to beat.

Lentils, oats, quinoa, tofu, and nuts all pack protein and calories—and they don’t require feeding and watering another animal first. They store well, grow fast, and don’t poop methane.

In terms of food security, sustainability, and sheer practicality, shifting to plant-based staples is a no-brainer. We can feed more people with fewer resources and far less environmental damage.

Meat may be calorie-dense—but so is crude oil. That doesn’t mean it belongs on your plate.
