# Argument 22: "It’s part of my religion."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Religious texts are interpreted—and ethical evolution is part of every faith. Causing unnecessary harm can’t be sacred if compassion is core.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Most religions offer vegan or vegetarian options—and millions of believers already make that choice. It’s entirely doable within your faith.

**Factual TL;DR:**
No major religion *requires* eating animals. And many spiritual leaders support plant-based living as a compassionate, responsible choice.

## Ethical Response

Many religious traditions emphasize compassion, mercy, and stewardship. Interpreting them as mandates to kill animals ignores the broader moral arc. Most sacred texts were written in a time when survival required animal use—but that’s no longer true.

Faith evolves. We no longer stone people, burn witches, or treat illness with bloodletting. Why cling to animal suffering when alternatives abound?

If your religion values kindness, veganism aligns with it—not contradicts it.

## Practical Response

Religious traditions often allow for ethical flexibility. Lent, kosher, halal, and other dietary rules already accommodate plant-based eating.

There are Muslim vegans, Christian vegans, Hindu vegans, Jewish vegans—you name it. Major religious scholars and leaders have supported plant-based lifestyles as aligned with their faith’s values.

If you want to honor your faith without harming animals, it’s not only possible—it’s increasingly common.

## Factual Response

Most major religions were developed in times when survival often required animal products. But they also contain themes of compassion, nonviolence, and stewardship—principles perfectly compatible with veganism.

There’s no commandment in any holy book that says “Thou must eat bacon.” In fact, many faiths historically restricted meat, and some encouraged vegetarianism (like Jainism, certain branches of Buddhism, or Seventh-day Adventism).

Religious practice isn’t static. It evolves—just like our understanding of ethics and nutrition. If your goal is to do less harm, most faiths are on your side.
