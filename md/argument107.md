# Argument 107: "There’s no proof veganism is healthy long-term."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Millions live healthily on vegan diets; lack of “perfect proof” isn’t a reason for harm.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Decades of research show plant-based diets prevent disease and support longevity.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Evidence plus global experience proves veganism is safe and sustainable.

## Ethical Response

It’s fair to want evidence before making big changes, but demanding absolute proof sets an impossible standard. Veganism isn’t an untested experiment; it’s a way of eating that millions of people worldwide live by every day. Cultures with plant-heavy diets—like in parts of Asia and the Mediterranean—have some of the longest lifespans in the world.

Waiting for perfect evidence while continuing to consume animal products keeps harm in place. Ethical decisions are often made on the best available evidence, not certainty. Veganism is supported by decades of research showing that reducing animal products improves health and the planet.

Living kindly doesn’t require perfect data, just informed choices.

## Factual Response

Studies consistently show that well-planned vegan diets are nutritionally adequate for all life stages, from infancy to old age. Large-scale research links plant-based diets to lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and some cancers. Organizations like the American Heart Association and the British Dietetic Association have endorsed vegan diets as safe and beneficial.

While no diet is perfect, veganism has one of the strongest evidence bases for reducing chronic disease risk. The idea that it’s “unproven” ignores decades of science.

The weight of research supports plant-based eating as both healthy and sustainable.

## Practical Response

If you’re worried about nutrient deficiencies, there are simple solutions: fortified foods and supplements (like B12) make it easy to stay balanced. Modern nutrition tools ensure that veganism is safe for anyone willing to plan, just like with any diet.

Millions of people live vegan long-term, thriving as athletes, parents, and seniors. Global cultures that rely mostly on plants show that this way of eating is not just sustainable but optimal for health.

Proof isn’t just in studies; it’s in lived experience backed by science.
