# Argument 26: "Animals are just here for us to use."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Saying animals exist for us is entitlement—not ethics. Their lives have value beyond our desires.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Treating animals as tools blinds us to better solutions. We don’t need to exploit them to thrive.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Biology shows animals exist for themselves. They seek comfort, avoid pain, and form relationships—not to serve humans.

## Ethical Response

This argument mirrors the mindset of every oppressive system in history: “They exist to serve us.” Whether applied to people or animals, it’s rooted in domination and convenience—not morality.

Animals aren’t resources—they’re sentient beings with their own interests, feelings, and will to live. Using them simply because we can ignores their right not to suffer.

We share this planet—not own it.

## Practical Response

Believing animals exist for us limits innovation and compassion. We now have plant-based proteins, lab-grown meat, and vegan alternatives for everything from leather to cheese.

Using animals isn’t necessary—it’s a habit. And once we break that habit, we see that thriving without exploitation is not only possible—it’s preferable.

Liberation makes more sense than domination.

## Factual Response

From a scientific standpoint, animals aren’t “here for us”—they’re here for themselves. Evolution doesn’t assign purpose—it creates survival strategies. Chickens don’t lay eggs for us. Cows don’t produce milk for humans. These are biological processes—not gifts.

Studies show animals think, feel, play, bond, and even grieve. They’re not tools—they’re individuals.

To say they exist for our use is not a fact—it’s a justification.
