# Argument 82: "Vegans kill plants, so you’re just as bad."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Plants don’t have sentience like animals; reducing harm still matters.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Science shows plants lack a brain or capacity to feel pain.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Eating plants directly kills fewer plants than raising animals.

## Ethical Response

This argument equates plant life with animal life, suggesting vegans are hypocrites. But ethics is about harm and suffering. Animals have nervous systems, emotions, and a desire to live; plants do not. Killing a carrot is not morally equivalent to killing a cow. Pretending they’re the same minimizes real suffering.

If the goal is harm reduction, veganism still wins. Even if plants had feelings, raising animals would kill far more plants because livestock eat massive amounts of crops. A plant-based diet minimizes suffering on every level.

This argument is often used to dismiss veganism entirely rather than consider its ethical foundation. If we care about life, we should reduce harm where it matters most—starting with sentient beings who clearly feel pain.

No ethical system treats all life as morally identical. Prioritizing sentient beings is consistent, not hypocritical.

## Factual Response

Plants are alive, but they lack a central nervous system, brain, or the structures necessary for consciousness. While plants can respond to stimuli, there is no evidence they experience pain or suffering. Their survival mechanisms are biochemical, not emotional or sensory.

Animal agriculture kills plants on a massive scale, too. Livestock consume the majority of global soy, corn, and grain crops. By eating animals, humans indirectly kill far more plants than vegans do. A vegan diet is the most plant-efficient way to eat.

Scientific consensus supports focusing harm reduction on sentient beings capable of suffering. Veganism aligns with this evidence.

## Practical Response

If someone is concerned about plant life, the most practical solution is to go vegan. Feeding plants to humans directly is more efficient and kills fewer plants overall. Raising animals wastes resources and destroys ecosystems.

This argument often serves as a deflection, not a genuine ethical stance. If people truly cared about minimizing harm to plants, they’d avoid supporting animal agriculture, which kills billions of animals and trillions of plants every year.

Veganism is the practical answer for anyone who values life, sentient or not.
