# Argument 30: "We’re smarter than animals."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Superior intelligence doesn’t justify exploitation. Ethics isn’t about IQ—it’s about compassion.

**Practical TL;DR:**
A high IQ doesn’t require a high kill count. Smarter choices should mean less harm.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Many animals display complex cognition. And intelligence doesn’t negate sentience.

## Ethical Response

If intelligence determined moral worth, then we’d rank humans too—putting babies, the disabled, or elderly below “smart” adults. That’s not how ethics works.

Being smarter doesn’t give us the right to harm others—especially when they’re capable of suffering. Exploiting someone because they’re less intelligent isn’t moral—it’s oppressive.

We don’t need to dominate. We need to care.

## Practical Response

If we’re so smart, why not make choices that reduce suffering? Isn’t that what intelligence is *for*?

We’ve invented plant-based meats, sustainable systems, and ethical philosophies. Using those tools to avoid needless harm is the smartest move we’ve got.

Cleverness should lead to kindness—not cruelty.

## Factual Response

Crows use tools. Octopuses solve puzzles. Pigs outperform dogs in memory tests. Intelligence isn’t exclusive to humans—it exists on a spectrum across species.

But more importantly, pain and fear don’t require genius. A being doesn’t need to write poetry to suffer.

Ethically, it’s not about who’s smartest. It’s about who can feel.
