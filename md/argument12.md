# Argument 12: "I need to eat animal products for my health."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Needing something for your health is different from choosing it out of habit or misinformation. But for most people, a vegan diet is not only possible—it’s better for animals *and* for health.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Most major health organizations agree: you can thrive on a vegan diet. If you’re worried about health, work with a dietitian—not a steakhouse.

**Factual TL;DR:**
There is no nutrient in animal products that can’t be obtained from plant-based sources or supplements. A vegan diet is safe, complete, and often healthier.

## Ethical Response

Let’s assume, for argument’s sake, that someone truly couldn’t survive without animal products. Would that justify harming animals? Maybe—but that’s not the reality for most people.

When alternatives exist, continuing to exploit animals isn’t about survival—it’s about preference, tradition, or fear of change. Health is important, but it’s often used as a moral shield for choices that are neither necessary nor ethical.

Billions of animals suffer each year so people can keep eating the way they always have, not because their lives depend on it. The ethical path isn’t about perfection—it’s about minimizing harm wherever we can. And for the vast majority of people, that includes eating plant-based.

## Practical Response

The idea that we *need* animal products to be healthy is outdated—and often spread by industries with a financial stake in the answer.

In reality, well-planned vegan diets can meet all nutritional needs, from protein to iron to omega-3s. Yes, some nutrients (like B12) need supplementation—but guess what? Animals are supplemented with B12 too. You're just cutting out the middle-cow.

If you have specific health issues or restrictions, talk to a dietitian familiar with plant-based eating. Millions of people around the world—including athletes, doctors, and nutritionists—are thriving without animal products.

Veganism isn’t about risking your health—it’s about upgrading it while reducing harm.

## Factual Response

Let’s look at the science: the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, British Dietetic Association, and World Health Organization all agree that a vegan diet is nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including pregnancy and childhood.

Animal products do contain nutrients—so do plants. The difference? Animal-based diets come with baggage: higher cholesterol, saturated fat, inflammation, and increased risk of chronic disease.

You *can* get protein from beans, tofu, lentils, seitan, and whole grains. You *can* get calcium from leafy greens and fortified plant milks. Iron from legumes. Omega-3s from flax, chia, and algae oil. B12 from a weekly supplement.

There is no biological requirement to eat animals—only cultural habit. And breaking that habit is one of the healthiest moves you can make.
