# Argument 27: "Vegans are annoying / preachy / self-righteous."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Don’t confuse discomfort with arrogance. Pointing out injustice isn’t self-righteous—it’s necessary.

**Practical TL;DR:**
If a message is true, being annoyed by it doesn’t make it false. Focus on the issue—not the tone.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Veganism’s growth isn’t due to “preachiness”—it’s due to facts, ethics, and impact. The data stands on its own.

## Ethical Response

Every social justice movement faced this exact criticism. Abolitionists were “preachy.” Suffragettes were “shrill.” Civil rights leaders were “too loud.” Now vegans are “annoying.”

Maybe the problem isn’t the messenger—it’s the message.

Pointing out cruelty will always ruffle feathers (no pun intended). But silence helps the status quo. Speaking up—even if imperfectly—is better than pretending nothing’s wrong.

## Practical Response

Yes, some vegans are annoying. So are some meat-eaters. So are some people who clap when planes land. That’s life.

But criticizing someone for caring about suffering is misplaced. You don’t have to like their delivery—but you should examine the content.

Would you dismiss anti-racism because one activist was rude? Then don’t dismiss veganism because one person was pushy.

## Factual Response

Veganism has grown because of health research, environmental science, and undercover investigations—not because vegans are “preachy.”

If anything, media often silences or mocks vegan voices while amplifying backlash. Despite this, the facts remain: animal agriculture is destructive, avoidable, and morally troubling.

It’s easier to call vegans annoying than it is to face uncomfortable truths. But discomfort isn’t disproof.
