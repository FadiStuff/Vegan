# Argument 52: "Jesus ate fish and lamb — why shouldn’t I?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
What someone did 2,000 years ago doesn’t determine what’s moral today. We know more, have more options, and can choose better.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
While Jesus likely ate some animal products, he lived in a vastly different time. His message was about compassion and justice—not diet plans.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You don’t have to copy Jesus’s menu to follow his message. A vegan lifestyle can reflect his values even more clearly in today’s world.

## Ethical Response

Just because someone in the past did something doesn’t mean it’s right to keep doing it—especially when circumstances have changed.

Jesus lived in a time of scarcity, where eating fish or lamb may have been necessary for survival. That’s not the case for most people today. We have access to abundant, cruelty-free options.

What defined Jesus wasn’t his diet—it was his compassion, humility, and care for the vulnerable. Those values can be lived out more fully through veganism, not less.

## Factual Response

There’s little doubt that Jesus ate some animal products—fish is mentioned multiple times in scripture. But his historical context matters.

- He wasn’t supporting factory farming.
- He wasn’t endorsing global slaughterhouses.
- He wasn’t holding up bacon as a moral standard.

Jesus didn’t teach dietary laws—he taught love, mercy, and justice. And none of that requires harming animals today.

In fact, many modern Christians believe that a vegan lifestyle is closer to the peaceable kingdom described in Isaiah than any first-century meal.

## Practical Response

You don’t follow Jesus by mimicking his breakfast—you follow him by living his values.

Compassion, justice, mercy—these are timeless. And in the 21st century, those principles are deeply aligned with veganism.

Plenty of Christians choose plant-based living as a way to express their faith more fully. You’re not less faithful for rejecting animal suffering—you’re more intentional.

The question isn’t “What did Jesus eat?”  
It’s “What would he choose now?”
