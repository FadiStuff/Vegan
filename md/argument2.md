# Argument 2: "We're just part of the food chain, and we're on top."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Appealing to nature doesn’t justify cruelty. Just because lions kill doesn’t mean we should — we have moral agency and better options.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Being “on top” of the food chain doesn’t require eating animals. We can live well without killing, and that’s a better use of our power.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Humans are omnivores, not obligate carnivores. Our biology supports plant-based eating — and modern science backs it up.

## Ethical Response

The “top of the food chain” argument suggests that since we’re the dominant species, we’re entitled to use and kill others. But power isn’t the same as moral right. Lions also kill, but lions don’t have moral frameworks, ethics classes, or the ability to cook lentils. We do.

Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s ethical. Many violent behaviors occur in nature — it doesn’t mean we should emulate them. If anything, being “on top” should mean we’re capable of *more* compassion, not less. Having the ability to choose means we should choose to do the least harm.

## Practical Response

Being high up in the food chain used to mean survival. Now, it’s often used to justify convenience. But we no longer hunt to survive — we shop. And what we put in our carts can reflect our values. You can be healthy, satisfied, and strong on a plant-based diet — no killing required.

True dominance doesn’t mean acting like predators — it means breaking the cycle. We don’t have to cause suffering just because we can. In fact, choosing not to is a far more impressive display of intelligence and leadership.

## Factual Response

Yes, humans are omnivores — we *can* digest both plants and animals. But physiologically, we’re not built like apex predators. We lack sharp claws, powerful jaws, or the ability to take down prey with our bare hands. Our anatomy and digestion actually favor plant-based foods.

Science supports this. The American Dietetic Association and other major health organizations agree that a well-planned vegan diet is healthy for all stages of life. So even if we’re “on top,” there’s no biological need to eat animals — only cultural habit and taste preference.

Bottom line: being part of the food chain doesn’t mean you have to keep chewing your way through it.
