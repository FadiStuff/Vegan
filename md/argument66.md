## Ethical Response

Ethics aren’t just for the wealthy. Choosing not to harm animals is a value anyone can hold, no matter their income. The belief that veganism is expensive comes from marketing, not reality. Grocery store shelves are full of affordable plant-based foods—beans, rice, potatoes, frozen vegetables, pasta, and oats. These foods cost less than meat, cheese, and eggs and are available in nearly every store.

Saying compassion is a privilege excuses cruelty rather than challenging injustice. The problem isn’t veganism—it’s a food system that subsidizes animal products while pricing up fresh produce. Eating vegan doesn’t mean buying trendy brands or “superfoods”; it means eating in a way that avoids unnecessary suffering. Being kind to animals shouldn’t depend on your bank account.

## Factual Response

Plant-based eating doesn’t have to be expensive. Beans, lentils, grains, tofu, seasonal produce, and frozen vegetables are some of the cheapest items in most grocery stores. Studies show that people eating plant-based diets often spend less on groceries than meat-eaters.

Processed vegan options—like imitation meats—are optional, not required. Many traditional diets around the world are mostly plant-based because these foods are affordable, filling, and widely available. Shifting your focus from specialty products to basic staples makes veganism affordable for almost anyone.

## Practical Response

If vegan eating feels expensive, focus on whole foods. Buy rice, pasta, beans, oats, and potatoes in bulk. Frozen vegetables and canned goods are affordable and last a long time. Skip expensive substitutes and base your meals on simple, nutrient-dense foods. Meal prep and batch cooking also reduce costs.

Veganism doesn’t have to be a financial burden; it’s often the opposite. Start simple, use basic ingredients, and you’ll see your grocery bill drop while your impact on animals shrinks.
