# Argument 65: "But, surely God let Adam and Eve eat meat?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:** 
Dominion does not mean consumption. Stewardship is not a license to kill.  

**Factual TL;DR:** 
Genesis explicitly gives Adam and Eve plants to eat, not animals. Meat only appears later, as a concession, not the design.  

**Practical TL;DR:** 
Even if the Bible allowed meat after the Fall, we now have abundant plant-based foods. Nothing compels us to continue that concession today.

## Ethical Response

The claim that Adam and Eve could eat animals because they had "dominion" over them is a misreading. Dominion in the biblical context aligns with responsibility, not exploitation. A shepherd has dominion over his flock, but his role is to protect and care for them, not to slaughter at whim. The king analogy fits perfectly: a ruler has dominion over subjects, but it would be grotesque to suggest this grants him the right to eat them. Authority without moral responsibility is tyranny. The biblical story presents dominion as stewardship — a trust, not a hunting license.

## Factual Response

Genesis 1:29 states clearly: "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food." The next verse extends the same principle to animals: they too are given plants to eat. There is no permission for meat consumption in the Eden narrative. The first biblical reference to eating meat does not appear until after the Flood in Genesis 9, framed as a reluctant concession in a fallen world. So historically, the "ideal" diet described in scripture was entirely plant-based. Meat only enters the story after catastrophe, not creation.

## Practical Response

Even if one insists that meat was later permitted, that does not mean it is mandated or desirable today. We now understand nutrition far better than people did in the ancient world. We also know the immense suffering and ecological destruction tied to animal agriculture. If Eden's diet was plants, and if dominion meant stewardship, then the practical path forward is obvious: live in alignment with that vision. We have abundant plant-based foods — there is no reason to cling to an outdated concession made in the aftermath of a flood.
