# Argument 84: "If everyone went vegan, farm animals would go extinct."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Animals bred for exploitation don’t owe us their existence.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
A gradual transition would reduce populations humanely, not wipe them out overnight.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
We can protect species while ending factory farming.

## Ethical Response

Some worry that if the world went vegan, farm animals would disappear. This assumes that animals’ value lies only in their utility to humans. But breeding billions of animals into existence only to slaughter them is not a kindness; it’s a cycle of harm. Ethical concern is not about keeping animals alive just to kill them—it’s about stopping unnecessary suffering.

Domesticated farm animals exist in such large numbers only because humans breed them for profit. These animals aren’t wild species in need of preservation; they’re products of industrial agriculture. Ending their exploitation doesn’t mean abandoning them; it means no longer forcing them into a life of suffering and premature death.

If anything, veganism allows us to treat these animals with dignity. Sanctuaries and conservation efforts can ensure their safety during a transition to a plant-based system. Letting future generations of animals be born into freedom—or not bred at all—is a form of mercy, not extinction.

Veganism isn’t about erasing animals; it’s about ending harm.

## Factual Response

The idea that all farm animals would vanish overnight is unrealistic. A cultural shift toward veganism would be gradual, allowing animal populations to decrease naturally over time. Farmers would breed fewer animals as demand for meat and dairy dropped, reducing suffering without mass culling.

Farm animal populations today are artificially inflated by industrial farming. Billions of cows, pigs, and chickens exist because they are continuously bred for profit. Without constant breeding, these populations would stabilize or decline to sustainable levels, much like any managed species.

Wild animals are a different story—habitat restoration from reduced animal farming would benefit countless species. Land used for grazing and feed crops could be rewilded, improving biodiversity rather than reducing it.

The fear of “extinction” misunderstands how these animals came to exist in such high numbers.

## Practical Response

Transitioning away from factory farming would create opportunities to repurpose farmland, invest in plant-based agriculture, and support sanctuaries. Instead of mass extinction, animals would live out their lives in safety while fewer are bred into suffering.

Some heritage breeds could be preserved through sanctuaries, conservation farms, and hobby farming, much like we preserve endangered or historic plants. Their existence wouldn’t end; their exploitation would.

Veganism isn’t about abandoning animals. It’s about redefining our relationship with them, shifting from exploitation to stewardship. Fewer animals suffering isn’t a tragedy—it’s progress.
