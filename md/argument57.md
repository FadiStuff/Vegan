# Argument 57: "You can’t build muscle without meat."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Strength doesn’t have to come at the expense of another life—muscle can be built on plants alone.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Many elite athletes, bodybuilders, and strength competitors thrive on plant-based diets, proving meat isn’t required for muscle growth.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Eat enough calories, prioritize protein-rich plant foods, train consistently—muscle will follow without a single steak.

## Ethical Response

The ability to gain muscle doesn’t justify killing animals. If we can reach our physical goals without causing harm, why wouldn’t we?

Meat has been romanticized as the ultimate “muscle food,” but that’s cultural marketing, not moral reasoning. A plant-based diet fuels growth just as well, without taking anyone’s life.

Strength should be measured not just by the size of our muscles, but by the compassion behind our choices.

## Factual Response

Muscle growth depends on adequate protein, calories, and progressive resistance training—not on meat. Plant-based athletes like Patrik Baboumian (strongman) and Venus Williams (tennis champion) prove the point.

Lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, edamame, quinoa, nuts, seeds, and legumes offer all essential amino acids. Studies show plant protein supports muscle growth and recovery as effectively as animal protein when total intake is sufficient.

The myth persists because meat is marketed as “manly” and “protein-rich,” but the science says plants work just as well.

## Practical Response

Building muscle on plants is straightforward: aim for 1.6–2.2g of protein per kg of body weight, spread over 3–5 meals.

Example: oatmeal with soy milk and peanut butter, lentil chili with whole grain bread, tofu stir-fry with brown rice, protein shake with pea protein.

Train consistently, rest well, and eat enough—your muscles won’t care whether the amino acids came from steak or seitan.
