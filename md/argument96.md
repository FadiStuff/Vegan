# Argument 96: "The meat and dairy industries are essential for the economy."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Profit doesn’t justify cruelty; industries can evolve.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Animal agriculture relies on subsidies and is not as “essential” as claimed.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Shifting to plant-based agriculture strengthens the economy long-term.

## Ethical Response

It’s true that meat and dairy industries are large and deeply rooted in many countries. But the size of an industry doesn’t determine its morality. History is full of once-“essential” industries—like tobacco, slavery, and fossil fuels—that society eventually recognized as harmful. Profit doesn’t erase ethical responsibility, and jobs tied to harm aren’t automatically justified.

Veganism isn’t about destroying livelihoods; it’s about imagining an economy that doesn’t rely on suffering. With creativity and investment, we can support farmers and workers while transitioning away from practices that harm animals, people, and the planet. Economies are meant to serve society, not the other way around.

When compassion guides innovation, industries can evolve to create prosperity without cruelty.

## Factual Response

Meat and dairy industries are heavily subsidized. In many countries, billions of tax dollars keep animal agriculture profitable. Without these subsidies, plant-based foods would be even cheaper and more competitive. Studies show that transitioning to plant-based agriculture would free up land, resources, and money currently tied up in supporting inefficient livestock systems.

The economic argument also overlooks environmental costs. Animal farming drives deforestation, water shortages, and climate change—costs that taxpayers and future generations will bear. The claim of “essential” ignores how much public money props up a system that isn’t sustainable.

Plant-based industries are already growing rapidly, creating new opportunities for farmers and businesses. Economic strength lies in adaptation, not clinging to harmful industries.

## Practical Response

Transitioning away from animal agriculture doesn’t mean economic collapse. Governments and nonprofits are already supporting farmers in shifting to plant-based crops. These crops often require fewer resources and can be sold at higher profit margins. The plant-based food sector is projected to be worth hundreds of billions within decades.

Countries that lead this transition will gain economic advantages. Supporting innovation in plant-based foods, lab-grown meat, and sustainable farming could create more jobs than sticking with outdated industries.

The economy isn’t static. We’ve seen transitions like this before, and with planning, this one can be a success story too.
