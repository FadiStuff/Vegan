# Argument 35: "What about farmers’ jobs if we all became vegan?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Jobs don’t justify cruelty. If an industry causes suffering, it’s our duty to evolve it—not excuse it.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Farming jobs will change—not disappear. Plant-based agriculture, vertical farming, and food innovation are growing fast.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Industries adapt all the time. We no longer have whalers or asbestos miners. We can support farmers through a just transition.

## Ethical Response

No one wants to see farmers suffer. But we also shouldn’t preserve harmful industries just because people rely on them. That logic would defend sweatshops, logging rainforests, or even selling tobacco.

The question isn’t whether jobs matter—they do. The question is whether some jobs justify cruelty. If an industry profits from the suffering and death of animals, then change is morally necessary.

We have a responsibility to help farmers transition—not to freeze progress out of fear.

## Factual Response

If the world shifted toward veganism, agriculture wouldn’t vanish—it would transform. Land currently used to grow animal feed could grow food directly for humans. That’s more efficient and sustainable.

Many farmers already grow crops, and others are beginning to shift toward plant-based proteins, regenerative systems, or even lab-grown innovations. With government support and smart policy, farmers can adapt to meet changing demand.

Industries change all the time. Horse-and-buggy jobs didn’t survive the car. That wasn’t a tragedy—it was progress.

## Practical Response

The economy is not static. We’ve phased out coal jobs, retooled factories, and seen entire professions come and go. Animal farming is no different. And unlike most industries, it comes with a heavy ethical and environmental cost.

Luckily, alternatives are booming. Plant-based meat, oat milk, precision fermentation—it’s a job-generating machine. With training, subsidies, and smart incentives, farmers can shift to producing sustainable crops or joining new food tech sectors.

Instead of asking how to preserve old jobs, let’s ask how to create better ones.
