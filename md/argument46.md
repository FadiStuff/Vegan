# Argument 46: "The Bible says it’s okay to eat meat."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even if meat was permitted in ancient times, that doesn’t make it morally right today. We’re not obligated to follow every verse—especially when compassion calls us higher.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
The Bible is a complex, often contradictory text. While it permits eating meat in some passages, it also promotes mercy, stewardship, and plant-based living in others.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Many Christians choose veganism to better reflect the teachings of Jesus—love, mercy, and care for the vulnerable. You can follow your faith *and* avoid causing harm.

## Ethical Response

The Bible says a lot of things. That doesn’t mean we still do them all.

It condones slavery. It permits polygamy. It even mandates stoning people for minor offenses. Clearly, we’ve chosen to leave some things behind as human understanding evolves.

So when someone says, “The Bible says it’s okay to eat meat,” the better question is: *Should we still be doing it?*

Jesus taught compassion, mercy, and care for the least among us. If that applies to humans, why not animals—especially when we now understand their capacity to suffer?

## Factual Response

Yes, meat is present in the Bible. But so are plant-based teachings.

Genesis 1:29 describes God’s original diet for humanity: fruits, seeds, and plants. It wasn’t until after the flood—when the Earth was devastated—that meat was allowed (Genesis 9:3). Many scholars see this not as divine ideal, but as reluctant permission under hardship.

There are also visions of a peaceful, plant-based future:
> “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb… they shall not hurt or destroy.” (Isaiah 11:6–9)

The Bible isn’t a one-note justification for meat—it’s a spiritual document layered with metaphor, context, and evolution.

## Practical Response

Plenty of Christians are vegan—not in spite of their faith, but *because* of it.

They believe that loving your neighbor extends to how we treat animals and the planet. They see factory farming as incompatible with Christ’s call to mercy and humility. And they choose foods that reflect values like stewardship and justice.

You don’t need to rewrite scripture to go vegan. You just need to ask: *What would love do?*

If Jesus fed the hungry, healed the sick, and walked gently on the Earth—why shouldn’t we?
