# Argument 50: "Spirituality requires balance — veganism is too extreme."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Choosing not to harm animals isn’t extreme—it’s a compassionate and conscious act. True balance doesn’t require cruelty.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Veganism is often rooted in the same principles as spirituality: mindfulness, nonviolence, and interconnectedness. It’s not a rejection of balance—it’s a refined expression of it.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Many spiritual practitioners adopt veganism as a way to deepen their practice, not disrupt it. You can be centered and compassionate at the same time.

## Ethical Response

Labeling compassion as “extreme” is a red flag.

If refusing to kill when you don’t have to is considered radical, maybe it’s our baseline that needs adjusting. Spirituality calls us to live with intention, kindness, and awareness—not to conform to comfortable habits.

True balance isn’t about doing a little bit of harm and a little bit of good. It’s about minimizing harm whenever we can—and veganism is a powerful way to do that.

## Factual Response

Spiritual traditions across the world teach us to live in harmony with all beings. Veganism aligns with this principle.

In Buddhism, Ahimsa (nonviolence) is foundational. In Hinduism, the cow is sacred and vegetarianism is a spiritual ideal. In Christianity, mercy and humility are core teachings.

Being vegan doesn’t reject balance—it honors it by refusing to dominate or destroy. Eating animals in a world where we don’t need to isn’t balance—it’s indulgence wrapped in ritual.

## Practical Response

Plenty of yogis, monks, and spiritual seekers are vegan—not because they’ve strayed from balance, but because they’ve deepened their alignment with it.

Veganism encourages:
- Mindful consumption
- Reduced attachment
- Greater awareness of suffering

If your spirituality values peace and clarity, plant-based living complements it beautifully.

What’s extreme: killing animals when we have abundant alternatives. What’s balanced: living gently, and leaving others in peace.
