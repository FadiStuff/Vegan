# Argument 98: "Animal agriculture creates jobs—going vegan would put people out of work."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Jobs tied to harm should evolve, not justify cruelty.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Plant-based sectors create jobs too, often with better sustainability.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Economic transitions have always created new opportunities.

## Ethical Response

It’s understandable to worry about jobs, but work tied to harm doesn’t justify continuing that harm. Many industries have been restructured or phased out as society evolved—think coal mining, asbestos production, or tobacco. We didn’t keep those industries alive because they created jobs; we invested in safer, healthier alternatives.

Animal agriculture employs millions, but so will the industries that replace it. Veganism isn’t about eliminating jobs; it’s about shifting resources toward industries that don’t rely on cruelty and environmental destruction. No one should be left behind, but that doesn’t mean we must cling to harmful systems.

Compassion should include both workers and animals. A just transition is possible.

## Factual Response

Plant-based food production already employs thousands and is growing rapidly. Studies suggest that shifting subsidies from animal agriculture to plant-based industries would create more jobs, as plant crops often require more labor per acre and generate higher profit margins.

Automation and consolidation in animal agriculture have already cut many jobs, while driving farmers into debt. The system is unstable and unsustainable. Diversification into plant crops, lab-grown meat, and other sustainable industries offers a more secure future.

Job loss is a valid concern, but history shows that economies adapt. Supporting workers during the transition is key.

## Practical Response

Economic transitions are nothing new. Governments can fund retraining programs, support cooperatives, and incentivize plant-based businesses. Farmers and workers can be leaders in this transition with the right resources.

Consumers also play a role; demand for plant-based products is skyrocketing, meaning more opportunities in farming, processing, and retail. Veganism isn’t job-killing; it’s job-shifting.

The focus should be on building a future where workers thrive without relying on harm.
