# Argument 39: "Vegan diets rely on monocultures and pesticides."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
No food system is perfect—but veganism drastically reduces harm. Industrial agriculture is used to grow animal feed too. Shifting away from meat helps reduce monoculture demand overall.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
The vast majority of monocrops (like corn and soy) are grown to feed livestock, not vegans. A plant-based diet still has a smaller pesticide and land-use footprint than an omnivorous one.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you're concerned about monocultures, cutting animal products is a great first step. You’ll reduce demand for the crops that fuel them.

## Ethical Response

The idea that vegan diets are hypocritical because they rely on monocultures is a distraction. Industrial agriculture isn't exclusive to vegans—it underpins the entire global food system, especially livestock farming.

In fact, most monocultures exist to feed animals, not people. Massive swaths of land are dedicated to growing corn and soy for pigs, cows, and chickens. If you eat those animals, you're relying on monocultures too—just with extra steps and extra suffering.

A vegan diet isn't flawless, but it's significantly more aligned with reducing harm. Instead of supporting the worst parts of the system, it begins to step away from them.

## Factual Response

Let’s get into the numbers. Over 70% of global soy and nearly half of global corn production is used for animal feed. These are some of the most prominent monocultures on Earth.

That means an omnivorous diet is heavily dependent on monocultures—more so than a vegan one. When you eat animals, you're consuming monoculture crops secondhand, with all the added inefficiency and waste that entails.

Pesticide use? Same story. The crops sprayed with the most chemicals often go straight to feedlots.

So while monocultures and pesticides are legitimate concerns, they're not an argument against veganism. They're an argument against the system that produces meat in the first place.

## Practical Response

If you're worried about monocultures and pesticides, going vegan actually helps.

Animal agriculture multiplies land use. You need huge fields of monoculture crops to feed animals, and then even more land to raise those animals. Switching to a plant-based diet cuts out the middleman.

And you don’t have to stop there. You can choose local produce, support organic growers, shop from biodiverse farms, or even grow your own food.

Veganism isn’t the end of the conversation—it’s the start of a smarter one.
