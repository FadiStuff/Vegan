# Argument 60: "Fake meat is unhealthy — it's very processed."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even if some plant-based meats are processed, they still avoid the ethical cost of killing animals.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Many processed plant-based meats are nutritionally comparable to—or healthier than—their animal-based counterparts, especially regarding cholesterol and saturated fat.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You don’t have to eat fake meat to be vegan, but it can be a convenient option alongside whole plant foods.

## Ethical Response

The main purpose of plant-based meats is to replace animal products without the cruelty. Even if some are processed, they still remove the slaughter from the supply chain.

Highly processed doesn’t automatically mean unhealthy—just as unprocessed doesn’t automatically mean good for you. The ethical bottom line remains: no animal had to die.

You can choose less-processed vegan foods if you prefer, but the existence of these products saves lives and helps many transition away from meat.

## Factual Response

Yes, many plant-based meats are processed—but so are most animal products, from hot dogs to bacon. The real question is: how does the nutritional profile compare?

Most fake meats have zero cholesterol and less saturated fat than meat. They often contain added fiber, which animal products lack entirely. Sodium can be higher, so they’re best as part of a balanced diet, not the whole thing.

For people transitioning, plant-based meats can bridge the gap, providing familiar flavors without the health risks linked to red and processed meat consumption.

## Practical Response

If you’re aiming for optimal health, build your diet around whole plant foods—vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds—and use plant-based meats as occasional convenience foods.

Think of them like training wheels for going vegan: great for starting out, handy for busy days, but not essential once you’ve mastered the ride.

Enjoy a Beyond Burger at a barbecue, but make lentils, tofu, and veggies your everyday staples.
