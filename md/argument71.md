# Argument 71: "Vegan food is over-processed and chemical."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Veganism isn’t about fake meats; it’s about kindness and whole foods.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Most plant foods are minimally processed; animal farming is highly industrialized.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You don’t need fancy substitutes—basic ingredients make veganism simple.

## Ethical Response

Critics often point to packaged vegan meats and cheeses as proof vegan diets are unhealthy. But veganism isn’t defined by those products—it’s defined by compassion and the choice not to harm animals. Whole plant foods—fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds—are the foundation of vegan eating, and they’ve nourished humans for thousands of years.

Judging veganism by a handful of processed foods ignores that animal agriculture itself is deeply industrialized. Most animal products come from factory farms where animals are bred, medicated, slaughtered, and packaged on an industrial scale. Calling veganism “processed” while eating factory-farmed meat is a contradiction.

When people say vegan food is “chemical,” they’re often reacting to novelty, not facts. All food is made of chemicals, and plants are naturally rich in nutrients. Choosing veganism is about compassion first and foremost, and it doesn’t require relying on lab-made products. You can live vegan on simple, whole foods that are both ethical and nutritious.

Veganism isn’t about eating differently for its own sake; it’s about building a kinder food system. If someone doesn’t like vegan sausages, that’s fine—they can just eat beans and rice. Veganism isn’t limited to trendy brands; it’s a way of living aligned with empathy.

## Factual Response

Processed vegan foods are optional, not essential. Beans, lentils, whole grains, vegetables, tofu, tempeh, and fruit are all minimally processed and available everywhere. Meanwhile, meat, dairy, and eggs are heavily processed: animals are fed processed feed, given antibiotics, artificially bred, slaughtered, and packaged. The entire animal farming system is a form of processing.

Many people eat processed foods regardless of their diet. Chips, soda, and refined sugar are omnivore staples. Singling out vegan foods as “too processed” ignores the reality of most modern diets. Studies show that plant-based diets, when centered on whole foods, lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Ironically, replacing animal products with simple plant-based ingredients often reduces processing. A bag of lentils or oats has fewer steps from farm to table than a steak or cheese block, which required raising and feeding animals for months or years.

The claim that vegan diets are inherently processed is false. Veganism can be as simple or elaborate as you want it to be.

## Practical Response

Transitioning to veganism doesn’t require expensive substitutes. Focus on pantry staples like rice, beans, pasta, canned tomatoes, and frozen vegetables. These foods are affordable, nutritious, and easy to prepare. When you want convenience, vegan alternatives are available, but they’re not necessary.

Cooking simple plant-based meals saves time and money while avoiding excess processing. Batch cooking, meal prep, and freezer-friendly recipes make it easy to stay vegan without relying on packaged foods. Restaurants and stores are also improving their vegan offerings, making convenience options widely accessible for those who want them.

Veganism is flexible. You can cook entirely from scratch or enjoy store-bought options depending on your lifestyle. The choice is yours—and either way, you’re supporting a system that spares animals and benefits the planet.
