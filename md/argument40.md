# Argument 40: "Local meat is more sustainable than imported tofu."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Local doesn’t mean low-impact. Meat production—whether local or not—involves animal suffering and environmental damage that far outweigh tofu's footprint.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Transport accounts for a small slice of a food’s carbon footprint. The bulk comes from how it's produced. Even tofu flown across the world is usually far better for the environment than local beef.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you care about sustainability, switching from meat to plants matters more than switching from imported to local.

## Ethical Response

The word "local" has become a kind of moral shield. If it’s local, it must be good—right?

Not necessarily. Local meat still involves raising and killing animals, emitting methane, consuming huge resources, and contributing to biodiversity loss. The fact that the slaughterhouse is down the road doesn’t make the act more ethical.

Tofu might travel farther to reach your plate, but it doesn’t come with a lifetime of suffering attached. Ethics isn’t just about geography—it’s about impact.

## Factual Response

People often assume food miles are the biggest factor in a food’s environmental impact. They're not.

According to research from institutions like Oxford and Our World in Data, **transportation usually accounts for less than 10%** of a food's total carbon footprint. The vast majority comes from how the food is produced.

Livestock, especially cows, are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions—methane, land use, water waste, and more. Even tofu that’s imported from overseas usually has a much smaller environmental footprint than local beef, pork, or cheese.

So if you’re comparing local meat to tofu, you're comparing apples to chainsaws.

## Practical Response

If your goal is to eat sustainably, going local is a nice bonus—but going plant-based is the real win.

You could eat local meat and still have a bigger environmental footprint than someone eating imported beans. Why? Because animal agriculture is just that resource-intensive.

Want to do both? Great. Eat local *and* eat plants. There’s nothing stopping you from buying locally grown vegetables, legumes, or even locally made tofu if it’s available.

But if the choice is between tofu from abroad and meat from next door, the more sustainable option still isn’t wearing a face.
