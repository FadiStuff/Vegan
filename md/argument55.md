# Argument 55: "Plant protein isn’t ‘complete.’"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Protein quality isn’t an excuse to harm animals—especially when all essential amino acids are available from plants.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
You don’t need to eat animal products to get “complete” protein—variety in plant foods easily covers all essential amino acids.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Mixing foods like beans and rice or peanut butter on whole wheat bread makes “complete” protein without even trying.

## Ethical Response

The myth of “incomplete” plant protein has been used for decades to justify animal consumption. But the core question remains—why harm an animal when you can get all your nutrients without doing so?

Protein is just amino acids. Every essential amino acid exists in the plant kingdom. By eating a variety of plant foods over the course of the day, you give your body everything it needs—no suffering required.

If a vegan diet can meet your amino acid needs, then killing animals for “completeness” becomes unnecessary.

## Factual Response

The idea that you must combine specific plant foods at the same meal to make “complete” protein was debunked years ago. Your body maintains an amino acid pool and can combine them from different meals.

Foods like quinoa, soy, buckwheat, and hemp are naturally complete. Others—like beans, grains, nuts, and seeds—complement each other throughout the day.

The science is clear: with reasonable variety, plant-based eaters meet amino acid needs just fine.

## Practical Response

Making “complete” protein with plants isn’t complicated. Some classic combos: rice and beans, hummus and pita, lentil soup with bread, tofu stir-fry with brown rice.

You don’t even have to think about it much. If your daily meals include legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetables, you’re covered.

Instead of obsessing over protein charts, focus on eating whole, minimally processed plant foods—your amino acids will take care of themselves.
