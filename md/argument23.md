# Argument 23: "What about indigenous cultures that rely on animal products?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Indigenous survival needs don’t justify unnecessary killing by people who *don’t* rely on animals. Context matters—and most of us aren’t in theirs.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Indigenous communities make up a tiny percentage of global meat consumption. Most animal exploitation is industrial—and avoidable.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Most people using this argument aren't indigenous and don't live like indigenous people. Veganism is still a practical option for them.

## Ethical Response

Indigenous communities often live in ecosystems where plant-based options are limited. Their use of animals is based on survival, not convenience or profit. Comparing that to industrial animal agriculture is dishonest.

The ethical problem isn’t that some people rely on animals—it’s that most people *don’t*, but choose to exploit them anyway. Veganism doesn’t target indigenous people; it challenges avoidable harm.

Don’t hide behind cultures you don’t belong to to justify your own comfort.

## Practical Response

If you live off-grid in the Arctic, your food choices will differ from someone in Brooklyn or Berlin. That’s fine. Veganism isn’t about shaming survival—it’s about choosing compassion *when you can*.

Most people using this argument aren’t indigenous and aren’t reliant on animal products. They just want a free pass. But our ethics should reflect *our* realities, not someone else’s survival.

Being vegan where possible doesn’t erase cultural respect—it shows ethical consistency.

## Factual Response

Indigenous people account for less than 5% of the world’s population—and even less of its meat consumption. The vast majority of animal exploitation comes from factory farms serving urban consumers with dietary choices.

So while indigenous practices are worth understanding and respecting, they aren’t the core problem veganism seeks to address.

Bringing up indigenous survival to defend bacon cheeseburgers at Applebee’s is a bad-faith dodge.
