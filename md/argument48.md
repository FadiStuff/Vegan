# Argument 48: "Dominion over animals means we can use them."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Dominion doesn’t mean domination. True stewardship calls for care, not exploitation. Using power compassionately is the moral path.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Biblical references to "dominion" are often misunderstood. Many scholars interpret it as a call to responsible guardianship—not a license to harm.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You can live your values and your faith by choosing mercy. Dominion is about leadership—and good leaders protect the vulnerable.

## Ethical Response

Let’s be clear: having power over someone doesn’t mean it’s ethical to exploit them.

Interpreting “dominion” as a green light to use and kill animals reflects a misunderstanding of both morality and scripture. If anything, having dominion means being *more* responsible—not less.

Would we say a king is moral because he abuses his people? Or a parent because they exploit their child? Of course not.

True dominion is care. True leadership is service.

## Factual Response

The phrase “dominion over animals” appears in Genesis 1:26–28, often cited as divine permission to use animals however we want.

But many theologians and scholars argue this interpretation is flawed. The original Hebrew word *radah* can imply rulership—but also **guardianship or compassionate oversight**.

This aligns with other biblical themes:
- Stewardship of the Earth
- Mercy for all creatures
- Righteousness through kindness

So rather than granting blanket permission to harm animals, the Bible may be calling us to protect them.

## Practical Response

If you believe dominion means leadership, then ask: *What does good leadership look like?*

Good leaders don’t exploit the weak. They don’t destroy what they’re entrusted with. They guide with wisdom, restraint, and compassion.

Choosing not to eat animals doesn’t reject dominion—it fulfills it. You’re honoring the trust that comes with power, not abusing it.

In a world where we no longer need to kill animals to survive, mercy is the more faithful path.
