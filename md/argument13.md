# Argument 13: "It’s natural to eat animals."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Just because something is “natural” doesn’t mean it’s ethical. Lots of horrible things are natural—violence, disease, even infanticide. Morality means rising *above* nature, not hiding behind it.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Nature also gave us poison ivy, mosquitoes, and hurricanes. What’s natural isn’t always what’s smart—or survivable. We build better lives by going *beyond* nature.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Humans evolved as opportunistic omnivores, but that doesn’t mean we *must* eat animals. We’re biologically capable of thriving on a vegan diet—and that’s a scientific fact.

## Ethical Response

The appeal to nature is one of the oldest tricks in the book. But ethical behavior has never been about copying the wild. It’s about thinking, reflecting, and making conscious choices.

Sure, eating animals may be “natural” in the sense that humans have done it for millennia. So is war. So is greed. So is dying of preventable disease. “Natural” is not the same as *good*.

Morality asks: “Can we do better?” And today, we can. We can eat, thrive, and live long lives without harming animals. That makes the *natural* act of killing for food unnecessary—and when something harmful becomes unnecessary, it becomes unethical.

## Practical Response

Let’s face it—if we lived purely “by nature,” we’d be naked in caves eating raw meat and dying at 35 from a tooth infection. Practically speaking, we’ve left nature in the dust. We wear clothes, fly in planes, use antibiotics, and Google symptoms instead of rubbing herbs on wounds.

Claiming that eating animals is okay because it’s natural is like arguing against seatbelts because cavemen didn’t have them.

What’s *practical* today is using our knowledge, tools, and abundant food systems to nourish ourselves without causing unnecessary suffering. It’s not about rejecting nature—it’s about improving on it.

## Factual Response

Yes, humans evolved to eat a wide variety of foods, including animals. That made sense in the context of scarcity, migration, and survival. But being *able* to eat meat isn’t the same as *needing* to. We are biological generalists—capable of adapting.

Modern nutritional science confirms this: a well-planned vegan diet can meet all of our needs, from infancy through old age. Our bodies are remarkably flexible. We can extract iron from legumes, calcium from greens, omega-3s from algae oil.

So yes, eating animals is “natural.” But so is *not* eating them—especially when the natural world now includes oat milk, soy sausages, and vegan pizza that slaps.
