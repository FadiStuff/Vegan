# Argument 79: "Humans are at the top of the hierarchy, so guilt isn’t necessary."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Being powerful doesn’t erase moral responsibility.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Dominance doesn’t justify cruelty; intelligence gives us more responsibility, not less.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Using power with empathy creates a better world.

## Ethical Response

Some argue that humans are at the top of the natural hierarchy, so feeling guilt about eating animals is unnecessary. This belief assumes that might makes right: because we are stronger or smarter, we can do what we want. But morality has never been about power. In fact, those with the most power have the greatest responsibility to act ethically.

If we used this logic elsewhere, it would justify bullying, exploitation, and oppression. Strength does not make cruelty moral. History shows that societies progress when those in power choose compassion over domination. Veganism is a way to use human intelligence and innovation for good, breaking cycles of harm instead of excusing them.

Being at the “top” of a hierarchy doesn’t absolve us of guilt; it magnifies it. With power comes the choice to act with integrity. Choosing not to harm animals when alternatives exist is a moral high ground, not a weakness.

True strength lies in empathy, not domination. Veganism is a reflection of that strength.

## Factual Response

Evolution may have given humans intelligence and tools, but intelligence doesn’t justify cruelty. Many species display dominance hierarchies, but they also display cooperation and care. Our ability to reason and innovate makes us uniquely capable of minimizing harm. Using our brains to justify harm rather than reduce it is a failure of progress.

Modern science shows that animals feel pain, fear, and joy. Their emotional complexity undermines the argument that they are mere resources. The fact that humans can thrive without eating animals proves this hierarchy is unnecessary for survival.

Being “top of the food chain” is also misleading. The term describes ecosystems, not morality. In today’s world, humans are not hunters relying on instinct; we are consumers making deliberate choices.

Knowledge increases responsibility. The more we understand about animals’ experiences, the less acceptable it is to exploit them.

## Practical Response

Power gives us opportunities to make better choices. Veganism isn’t about rejecting humanity’s abilities—it’s about using them responsibly. With today’s technology, we can grow food without relying on factory farming, create meat alternatives, and share knowledge globally.

Guilt can be productive. It signals that our actions conflict with our values. Instead of dismissing guilt, we can use it to guide us toward a lifestyle that aligns with compassion.

Living vegan demonstrates that intelligence and morality can coexist. It’s a practical way to lead by example, proving that true leadership comes from empathy, not domination.

Our position in nature gives us choices. Choosing kindness makes us stronger, not weaker.
