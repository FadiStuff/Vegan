# Argument 8: "We’ve eaten meat for thousands of years."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Just because something is old doesn’t make it right. Slavery, sexism, and war are also ancient traditions—but we’ve moved on. It’s time we did the same with killing animals.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Our ancestors ate meat for survival. We eat it for taste. That’s a huge difference. Historical necessity doesn’t justify modern-day cruelty.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Tradition should guide us, not chain us. We’ve evolved in every area of life—medicine, technology, human rights. Our food choices should evolve too.

## Ethical Response

Appealing to tradition is a shaky moral defense. Yes, humans have eaten meat for thousands of years. We’ve also oppressed each other, waged war, and committed atrocities for just as long. Longevity doesn’t equal morality.

In the past, people ate meat to survive. Today, most of us eat it out of habit, convenience, or taste—none of which justify taking life. Our ancestors didn’t have grocery stores, tofu, or nutritional science. We do.

Morality isn’t about doing what’s always been done—it’s about doing better when we know better. Veganism is simply applying that principle to what’s on our plate.

## Factual Response

Historically, humans were opportunistic omnivores. We hunted when we could, scavenged when we had to, and ate plants whenever available. Meat wasn’t always central—it was seasonal, rare, and resource-intensive.

Today, things are different. Animal agriculture is industrialized, destructive, and unnecessary for survival. We have access to abundant plant-based foods, fortified products, and the nutritional know-how to thrive without meat.

So while eating animals may have made sense in a cave 20,000 years ago, it doesn’t hold up in a supermarket in 2025.

## Practical Response

We’ve moved beyond ancient practices in every area of life. We no longer use bloodletting to treat illness or leeches to balance “humors.” We’ve upgraded our morals and our technology. Why not our diets?

Tradition can offer comfort, but it shouldn’t excuse harm. Many traditional foods have already been veganized—there’s plant-based brisket, vegan tamales, dairy-free baklava. You don’t have to abandon culture to live ethically—you just have to evolve with it.

History is a story of progress. Veganism is just the next chapter.
