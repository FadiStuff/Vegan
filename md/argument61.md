# Argument 61: "But what about my backyard chickens?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even well-treated backyard chickens are still exploited for their eggs—and their lives are usually cut short when they’re no longer “productive.”

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Backyard flocks often involve selective breeding, separation from chicks, and killing of male chicks—practices similar to industrial egg farming.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You can care for chickens without eating their eggs—adopt them as companions, not commodities.

## Ethical Response

Backyard chickens may get fresh air, space to roam, and individual names—but they’re still being used for what they produce, not valued simply for who they are.

Most hens are bred to lay far more eggs than nature intended, which can cause serious health issues like calcium depletion and reproductive disorders. When their laying slows, many are killed or abandoned.

If we truly care for chickens, the most ethical choice is to let them live out their natural lives without exploiting them for eggs.

## Factual Response

While backyard setups look nothing like factory farms, many underlying harms remain. Commercial hatcheries—where most chicks originate—often kill male chicks on day one, since they can’t lay eggs and aren’t profitable for meat.

Even in small flocks, hens may suffer from prolapse, egg binding, or brittle bones due to overproduction. And when productivity drops, many are replaced rather than retired.

The key difference isn’t scale—it’s whether the animals’ lives are valued beyond their output.

## Practical Response

If you enjoy the presence of chickens, you can keep them as rescues or companions without taking their eggs. Feed them, give them shelter, let them live naturally—and return their eggs to them or use them for non-food purposes like compost.

For cooking, plant-based egg alternatives like tofu scramble, chickpea flour omelets, and commercial vegan egg replacers work perfectly.

Backyard chicken care can be compassionate—but only if it puts the chickens’ well-being above human convenience.
