# Argument 5: "But plants also are alive and feel pain."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Plants aren't sentient and can't suffer. Even if they could, a vegan diet kills far fewer plants than a meat-based one.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you're concerned about plant harm, veganism still minimizes it — raising animals requires feeding them massive amounts of crops.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
There’s no credible evidence that plants feel pain. They lack nervous systems, brains, or any structure capable of subjective experience.

## Ethical Response

This argument attempts to equate the life of a plant with that of an animal. But plants are not sentient beings — they don’t have a brain, a nervous system, or any capacity to feel suffering. Morally, what matters most isn’t simply being alive — it’s the ability to suffer, to feel pain, to have preferences and experiences. That’s why we worry about stepping on a dog but not mowing the lawn.

Even if we granted, for the sake of argument, that plants could somehow “feel,” eating animals would still be worse. Why? Because raising animals for food kills far more plants — animals are fed enormous amounts of crops. So if you're genuinely concerned about plant suffering, veganism still comes out as the more ethical path.

## Practical Response

Let’s say, hypothetically, plants do suffer. Then eating animals — who consume huge quantities of plants — causes even more plant suffering. A cow eats 20–25 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of beef. Pigs and chickens too require tons of plant-based feed. So animal agriculture is a wildly inefficient and destructive middle step.

By eating plants directly, vegans drastically reduce total plant use — and of course, spare the animals as well. So if you're worried about plant life, veganism minimizes harm on all fronts.

## Factual Response

Plants respond to stimuli — that’s true. They bend toward light, react to touch, and release chemicals when damaged. But this is not pain. Pain requires consciousness, a brain, or at the very least a nervous system capable of processing sensations. Plants have none of these.

The idea that plants feel pain is a misinterpretation of plant biology. Their reactions are chemical and mechanical, not sentient. It’s anthropomorphism — projecting human experience onto something that lacks the machinery to feel it. Until plants start screaming and sprinting away from lawnmowers, we’re safe to say veganism is still the most compassionate choice.
