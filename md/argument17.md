# Argument 17: "Being vegan is unnatural."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Morality isn’t about doing what’s “natural”—it’s about doing what’s right. Slavery and violence are natural too. That doesn’t make them ethical.

**Practical TL;DR:**
What’s “natural” today? Microwaves, medicine, and smartphones. A vegan lifestyle is entirely doable—and often healthier and more sustainable.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Humans are omnivores by adaptation, not obligation. A vegan diet is biologically viable and endorsed by leading health organizations.

## Ethical Response

The appeal to nature is a common but flawed argument. Just because something is “natural” doesn’t mean it’s morally good. Disease, war, and dominance hierarchies are natural too—but we don’t hold them up as ethical ideals.

What’s “natural” is often just what’s familiar or comfortable. But ethics asks more of us. If we can avoid harming sentient beings, why wouldn’t we—even if it takes effort or feels unfamiliar?

Veganism may not be traditional or ancestral, but it *is* compassionate. And in a modern world full of choices, choosing kindness over cruelty is the more evolved—and ethical—path.

## Practical Response

Modern life is anything but natural. We fly in planes, live in concrete towers, drink filtered water, and take antibiotics. So let’s not pretend we’re living off the land when we shop at supermarkets and cook with air fryers.

Veganism is practical, not primitive. It takes advantage of modern resources—nutritional science, plant-based innovation, global agriculture—to make compassionate living easier than ever.

If “natural” means refusing these tools in favor of killing animals, then maybe it’s time to redefine what kind of nature we want to live in.

## Factual Response

The idea that veganism is “unnatural” misunderstands both biology and history. Yes, humans can digest animal products—but we’re not biologically required to. We’re flexible omnivores. That flexibility is what allows us to *choose* a plant-based diet and still thrive.

In fact, major dietetic associations around the world confirm that well-planned vegan diets are nutritionally adequate for all stages of life.

Evolution gave us the tools to adapt. That includes adapting our diets in light of ethics, health, and sustainability. So if veganism is unnatural, so is using an iPhone to argue about it.
