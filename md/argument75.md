# Argument 75: "Veganism won’t fix climate change."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even if it’s not a silver bullet, veganism is a major step toward a livable planet.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Animal farming drives deforestation, emissions, and water waste; veganism cuts all three.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Vegan choices matter—especially when combined with systemic change.

## Ethical Response

It’s true that veganism alone won’t solve climate change. No single action can fix a crisis this complex. But dismissing veganism because it’s not a “perfect” solution misses the point. Ethical action often starts with personal choices that ripple outward. Veganism is one of the most direct ways to reduce harm today, both for animals and the environment.

Refusing to change because a single action isn’t enough leads to inaction. That logic would stop us from recycling, voting, or supporting renewable energy too. We can’t wait for governments or corporations to fix everything while continuing harmful habits. Choosing a plant-based diet is one way individuals can live their values and inspire broader change.

Animals are victims of climate change too. Droughts, floods, and habitat destruction kill wild animals, while billions more suffer in industrial farms that intensify environmental collapse. Veganism isn’t just an environmental choice; it’s a moral stance that challenges a system harming every living being.

No one person can solve the climate crisis, but together, individual decisions drive policy, innovation, and cultural change. Veganism is part of that movement toward a livable future.

## Factual Response

Animal agriculture is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. It’s responsible for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gases—more than the entire transportation sector. Vast amounts of land are used to grow feed crops, and raising animals requires immense water and energy resources. Shifting diets is one of the fastest ways to lower these pressures.

Research from Oxford University and other institutions shows that a global shift toward plant-based diets could reduce emissions by up to 70%, free up 75% of farmland, and allow massive reforestation, which would help absorb carbon dioxide. Even partial reductions in animal product consumption have measurable effects.

Veganism also reduces methane emissions from cattle, one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Plant-based food production is far more efficient, requiring fewer resources per calorie. This makes veganism a key climate solution, even if it’s not the only one.

The data is clear: changing how we eat is essential to fighting climate change. We can’t solve the problem without addressing animal agriculture.

## Practical Response

Practical climate action is about combining personal change with systemic reform. Going vegan is one of the most effective personal choices because it reduces demand for harmful industries. As more people adopt plant-based diets, businesses and policymakers respond, scaling up sustainable options and phasing out harmful ones.

Veganism doesn’t require perfection. It’s a daily choice that makes a measurable difference, especially when paired with other actions like voting for climate policies, supporting renewable energy, and reducing waste. It’s part of a larger puzzle where every piece matters.

Changing your diet also has social influence. Seeing others make ethical food choices normalizes them and encourages change within communities. Grassroots shifts often drive top-down reforms, and veganism is already pushing governments and corporations toward sustainable practices.

Veganism won’t singlehandedly “fix” climate change, but it’s one of the simplest, most impactful changes available today. It’s a foundation for a future where humans and the planet can thrive together.
