# Argument 41: "Cows help maintain grasslands and soil health."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Using animals as tools doesn’t justify exploiting them. There are more sustainable and ethical ways to support soil health that don’t involve raising and killing sentient beings.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
While properly managed grazing can benefit some ecosystems, most cattle farming today is industrial, destructive, and unsustainable. Cows aren't the only—or best—way to manage land.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
There are many effective, plant-centered methods for restoring soil and ecosystems. We don't need to rely on cows to do the job.

## Ethical Response

Even if cows could help with soil health, that doesn’t justify breeding, confining, and killing them for food. It's one thing to talk about land management—it's another to commodify living beings for convenience.

The ethical case against animal agriculture doesn’t disappear because there’s a side benefit. If that logic held, any practice that produced a net positive effect could be justified, regardless of the suffering it causes.

We should aim for solutions that help the planet **without** using animals as disposable tools.

## Factual Response

Yes, some regenerative grazing practices can improve soil health in specific contexts. But those cases are **not the norm**—they’re niche and small-scale.

Globally, the cattle industry is one of the largest drivers of deforestation, methane emissions, water consumption, and biodiversity loss. Most cows are not helping grasslands—they're raised in feedlots or on land that was once forest.

There are plenty of other methods to regenerate soil: cover cropping, composting, no-till farming, agroforestry. These approaches don’t require methane-spewing ruminants to work.

So while cows *can* play a role in certain systems, they’re far from necessary—and often counterproductive at scale.

## Practical Response

If your goal is to improve land health or fight climate change, relying on cows is an inefficient and outdated strategy.

There are better ways to restore grasslands and build healthy soil without animals: rotational cropping, native plant restoration, and permaculture practices, to name a few. These don’t require raising millions of animals or producing billions of tons of manure.

Bottom line: if we want to heal the planet, we should scale **plant-based** solutions, not livestock.
