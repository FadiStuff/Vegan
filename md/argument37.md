# Argument 37: "What about Vitamin B₁₂?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
The lack of B₁₂ in plants doesn’t mean we have to eat animals. It just means we need to be smart and supplement—just like farmers do for animals.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
B₁₂ is made by bacteria, not animals. Most farm animals today get it through supplements. So when you eat meat, you’re getting B₁₂ secondhand.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Taking a cheap, reliable B₁₂ supplement is easier and more efficient than getting it through meat. Problem solved.

## Ethical Response

Some people say that because plants don’t have B₁₂, eating animals must be natural—or even necessary. But that’s not how it works.

B₁₂ isn’t made by plants or animals—it’s made by bacteria. In the past, humans got B₁₂ from unwashed vegetables or drinking from streams. Today, we sanitize everything, which is good—but it also means we lose those natural sources of B₁₂.

So we supplement. And guess what? Farmers do too. Most cows and chickens raised for food don’t get B₁₂ naturally anymore. They’re given supplements. If animals need supplements and we eat them to get B₁₂… why not just take the supplement ourselves and skip the suffering?

## Factual Response

B₁₂ is essential for your nervous system and red blood cells. A deficiency can lead to fatigue, nerve damage, or worse. So yes, it’s important—but no, you don’t need meat to get it.

Animals don’t make B₁₂. They either consume it from bacteria in dirt and water—or, in modern farming, they’re given B₁₂ in their feed. That means the B₁₂ you get from meat was probably a supplement first.

With veganism, you’re not missing out—you’re just cutting out the middleman. A daily supplement or some fortified foods (like plant milk or cereal) gives you exactly what you need, without the animal cruelty.

## Practical Response

B₁₂ is one of the easiest nutrients to get on a vegan diet. You can take a small supplement once a day, or even just once a week. Or you can get it from fortified foods like plant-based milks, nutritional yeast, or cereal.

It’s affordable, effective, and widely available. No needles, no guesswork—just a simple fix.

And here’s the kicker: most farmed animals are getting B₁₂ supplements too. So when you eat meat for B₁₂, you’re basically just getting your vitamins secondhand.

So yes, B₁₂ matters. But it’s not a reason to eat animals. It’s just a reminder to take care of your health—something every diet has to do.
