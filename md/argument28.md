# Argument 28: "I couldn’t live without cheese / bacon / etc."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
Cravings don’t justify cruelty. Missing a food doesn’t outweigh another being’s right to live.

**Practical TL;DR:**
You won’t “live without” it—you’ll replace it. Vegan cheeses and bacons are everywhere now.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Studies show taste preferences can adapt. And plant-based versions are constantly improving.

## Ethical Response

We all have attachments—foods, traditions, habits. But taste pleasure doesn’t justify taking life. Saying “I love cheese too much” is honest—but it’s not ethical justification for an animal’s suffering.

You can miss cheese. You can crave bacon. But those feelings don’t make it right to kill sentient beings. Ethics asks us to weigh our desires against others’ lives. And in that equation, bacon loses.

## Practical Response

Let’s be practical: you don’t have to “live without” your favorite foods—you just need a version that doesn’t involve suffering.

Vegan cheese has come a long way. There are melty, creamy, sharp, stretchy options now. Vegan bacon? Smoky, crispy, delicious—and no pigs harmed.

Taste is powerful. But so is habit. Give your tastebuds a few weeks, and they’ll catch up with your ethics.

## Factual Response

Neurologically, taste preferences are flexible. Studies show that people can adjust to new flavors and textures over time—especially when motivated by ethics or health.

Meanwhile, the food industry is exploding with vegan alternatives. Market research shows steady improvement in quality, availability, and affordability of plant-based meats and cheeses.

You might “miss” a food at first. But biology and innovation are on your side.
