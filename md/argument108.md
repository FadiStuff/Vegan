# Argument 108: "Climate science is exaggerated; meat isn’t really a big problem."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Climate skepticism doesn’t excuse choices that harm the planet.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Peer-reviewed science shows animal agriculture is a leading driver of climate change.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Cutting meat is one of the most effective ways individuals can help the planet.

## Ethical Response

Dismissing climate science can feel comforting—it absolves us from responsibility. But skepticism doesn’t erase reality. The overwhelming consensus is that animal agriculture contributes significantly to global warming. Ignoring this evidence allows harm to continue unchecked, affecting future generations and vulnerable communities today.

Even if climate science were slightly overstated, the ethical choice is still to reduce harm where possible. Eating more plants is one of the simplest ways to lessen your footprint, and it aligns with compassion toward animals.

Choosing sustainability is about responsibility, not fear.

## Factual Response

Animal agriculture contributes around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions—similar to all transportation combined. It drives deforestation, methane emissions, and biodiversity loss. These numbers aren’t activist claims; they come from organizations like the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization.

Scientific consensus on climate change is as strong as consensus on smoking’s health risks. Denying this doesn’t make it less true. Eating less meat is one of the most impactful choices individuals can make.

Meat is not a minor player—it’s central to the climate crisis.

## Practical Response

Even if you don’t fully trust climate models, reducing meat has other clear benefits: better personal health, less animal suffering, cleaner water, and less pollution. Plant-based diets are a “no-regrets” option—they help regardless of your view on climate change.

Small actions add up, and your choices send a signal to industries and policymakers. Cutting meat is practical, affordable, and scientifically supported as a climate solution.

You don’t have to be a climate scientist to make a positive impact.
