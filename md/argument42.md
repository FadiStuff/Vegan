# Argument 42: "Vegan products have massive carbon footprints."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even if some vegan products have higher footprints than others, they still avoid the cruelty, slaughter, and emissions tied to animal agriculture. Ethics isn't just about carbon—it's about lives.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Studies show that plant-based foods consistently have lower carbon footprints than animal products—even when processed or imported. The worst vegan food is usually better than the best meat.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you're worried about emissions, cutting meat and dairy does far more than nitpicking plant-based products. Go vegan first, then optimize.

## Ethical Response

Pointing out that some vegan products have carbon footprints doesn’t absolve animal agriculture of its far worse impact.

Ethically, it’s a dodge. No food system is perfect, but veganism avoids the inherent violence of breeding, exploiting, and killing animals. If you’re comparing oat milk to cow’s milk, you’re not just comparing emissions—you’re comparing harm.

Trying to equate the two because “some tofu came on a truck” misses the bigger picture: animals suffer and die for food we don’t need.

## Factual Response

Yes, some vegan products are processed or imported. But compared to meat and dairy, they still win—by a lot.

Comprehensive food system studies (like those from Oxford and Our World in Data) show that even highly processed vegan options have **significantly lower emissions** than most animal products.

For example:
- Plant-based burgers use 90% less greenhouse gas than beef.
- Almond milk uses less water than dairy milk.
- A bag of lentils from across the world still beats a local steak in carbon cost.

Food miles and packaging matter—but production method matters *much more*. And plants are simply more efficient.

## Practical Response

If you’re aiming to reduce your carbon footprint, the biggest lever isn’t local vs. imported, or raw vs. processed. It’s plants vs. animals.

A vegan eating Beyond Burgers and imported lentils still produces a fraction of the emissions of a meat-eater eating “sustainable” pork or cheese. And the more whole foods you eat, the lower it gets.

Want to go the extra mile? Choose seasonal produce, avoid air-freighted foods, and cook from scratch. But don’t let perfection be the enemy of better.

Going vegan is the strongest move you can make. Everything after that is fine-tuning.
