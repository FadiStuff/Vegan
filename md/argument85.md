# Argument 85: "Not eating meat is unnatural because humans evolved to eat animals."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Evolution explains survival, not morality.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Humans evolved as omnivores but thrive on plants today.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
We can choose better than what evolution required.

## Ethical Response

Humans evolved to survive, not to be ethical. Evolution explains why we can eat animals, not why we should. Many harmful behaviors—violence, dominance, and exploitation—have evolutionary roots, but that doesn’t make them moral today. Progress means moving beyond survival instincts to create a kinder society.

Saying meat-eating is natural ignores that morality often asks us to override natural impulses. Theft, cheating, and aggression are “natural” behaviors too, but we have laws and ethics to discourage them. Morality evolves alongside society.

Veganism isn’t about denying human history; it’s about shaping humanity’s future. Our ability to reflect, empathize, and innovate allows us to make ethical choices, not just instinctive ones.

What’s natural isn’t always what’s right.

## Factual Response

Anthropology shows that humans evolved as opportunistic omnivores. Our ancestors ate what was available, often relying heavily on plants. Hunting was dangerous and energy-intensive, so early diets were mostly plant-based with occasional meat. Our bodies are versatile, designed for survival in varied environments.

Modern science proves humans can thrive on fully plant-based diets. Studies from major health organizations confirm that vegan diets meet all nutritional needs at every stage of life. The ability to eat meat doesn’t mean it’s essential.

Technology and global agriculture mean we no longer face the survival pressures of early humans. Our diets can prioritize health, sustainability, and ethics without sacrificing nutrition.

Evolution gave us adaptability; veganism is one way to use it wisely.

## Practical Response

Claiming veganism is “unnatural” ignores that nearly everything in modern life—medicine, technology, transportation—is also unnatural. We no longer live as hunter-gatherers; we make intentional choices about food based on health, values, and convenience.

Plant-based eating is not only possible but easier than ever. Supermarkets stock a range of options, and plant-based farming is efficient and sustainable. What was once necessary for survival is now unnecessary harm.

Being “natural” is not a moral goal; being compassionate is. We’ve outgrown the idea that survival instincts define what’s right. Veganism is a reflection of humanity’s capacity to choose empathy over instinct.
