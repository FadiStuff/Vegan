# Argument 38: "Soy farming causes deforestation."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Most soy is grown to feed animals, not people. If you're eating meat, you're likely contributing more to deforestation than any vegan ever could.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Over 75% of global soy is fed to livestock. Only a tiny fraction goes to human foods like tofu or soy milk. Blaming vegans for soy-driven deforestation is just factually backwards.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
If you want to reduce soy-related deforestation, ditch meat. That’s where most soy ends up anyway.

## Ethical Response

The argument sounds simple: soy farms are wrecking rainforests—so vegans must be to blame. But it’s not that simple.

Here’s the truth: the overwhelming majority of soy grown globally is not eaten by vegans or vegetarians—it’s fed to livestock. Pigs, chickens, cows—they consume massive quantities of soy, usually in the form of soymeal, as part of industrial animal agriculture.

So if you’re concerned about the ethics of deforestation, the most effective thing you can do is stop supporting the industries that use the most soy: meat and dairy. Vegans aren’t driving this destruction. They’re actively opting out of it.

## Factual Response

Let’s look at the numbers. About 75–80% of all soy grown worldwide is used for animal feed. Only about 6% is turned into food products for humans, like tofu, tempeh, soy milk, and soy sauce.

So if soy is causing deforestation (and yes, in some areas it is), it’s because we’re growing it to feed billions of farm animals—not to make vegan burgers.

On a per-person basis, a meat-eater’s soy footprint is much higher than a vegan’s. You eat one cow? That cow ate a truckload of soy. That’s how the system works.

So pointing fingers at tofu while chewing on a steak? That’s just bad math.

## Practical Response

If your concern is the environment, and especially deforestation, then the most practical step is simple: eat less meat—or none at all.

By going vegan, you drastically reduce your demand for soy. Not just because you’re eating less of it—but because you’re cutting out the animal feed industry entirely. A block of tofu might use a cup of soy. A steak? The cow it came from probably consumed pounds of it over its lifetime.

And let’s be honest—there’s no shortage of non-soy vegan foods. Beans, lentils, chickpeas, seitan, oats, potatoes, and nuts… the plant-based world doesn’t start and end with soy.

So if you want to protect forests, skip the steak—not the soy milk.
