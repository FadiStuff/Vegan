# Argument 11: "Animals are going to die anyway."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**
The fact that animals will die eventually doesn’t give us moral permission to kill them early—especially for avoidable reasons like taste or habit.

**Practical TL;DR:**
Killing animals for food shortens their lives drastically. Avoiding animal products gives them a chance to live fuller lives—or avoids breeding them into suffering at all.

**Factual TL;DR:**
Farmed animals are killed far younger than their natural lifespans. Their death is not natural—it’s manufactured by human demand.

## Ethical Response

Saying “they're going to die anyway” isn’t a justification—it’s a confession. Everyone dies eventually, including humans, but we don’t use that to justify violence. The inevitability of death doesn’t erase the ethical difference between letting someone die naturally and actively killing them when it’s avoidable.

Animals raised for food aren’t just dying—they're being intentionally bred, confined, and killed prematurely, often in horrifying ways. And all of it is unnecessary. Death may be natural, but exploitation isn't. Choosing to kill a sentient being for convenience when you could choose not to is an ethical failure, plain and simple.

## Practical Response

In nature, a cow might live 15 to 20 years. In the meat industry? Slaughtered at 1 or 2. Chickens get just 6 weeks. Pigs are killed as teenagers. Saying they were “going to die anyway” ignores how dramatically we shorten and control their lives for profit.

We’re not letting animals die—we're making them die, far earlier than they would otherwise. And we’re breeding billions into existence solely to kill them. Avoiding animal products isn’t just practical compassion—it stops this machine from running on your dollar.

A plant-based lifestyle avoids this unnecessary violence and simplifies your impact: fewer animals bred, fewer killed, less harm.

## Factual Response

The average lifespan of a farm animal in the meat or dairy industry is a fraction of what it would be in nature. Cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep are systematically slaughtered years—sometimes decades—before their natural death would occur.

The idea that “they’re going to die anyway” misrepresents the situation. These animals aren't dying of old age or natural causes—they're being killed *because* humans demand animal products. This is a system of human-controlled life and death.

The facts are clear: animal agriculture is not passive. It’s an industry built on breeding, controlling, and ending life for profit. And the less we participate, the less demand there is to keep that system going.
