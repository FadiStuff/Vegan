# Argument 62: "But my pet chicken lays eggs. Should I just leave them?"

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
A chicken’s eggs belong to her. The deeper issue isn’t whether to eat them—it’s how to break the cycle of breeding hens to overproduce for human use.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Modern hens lay far more eggs than wild birds due to human-directed breeding, which strains their bodies. You can reduce laying and care for them without consuming the eggs.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Focus on slowing or stopping unnecessary egg production and shifting chickens from “producers” to “companions.” This protects their health and ends participation in the egg system.

## Ethical Response

If you have a pet chicken, you didn’t create her breeding, but you are responsible for how you treat her now. Even if she roams freely and seems happy, she is still part of a cycle humans designed: breeding hens to lay far more eggs than is natural, and replacing them when their output slows.

In the wild, chickens’ ancestors laid only a small clutch each year. Selective breeding turned egg-laying into an almost daily event. This is exhausting for the hen, shortening her life and leaving her vulnerable to reproductive illness.

The past can’t be undone—you can’t un-breed a chicken. But you can decide what happens next. Every egg you choose not to eat, every hen you choose not to replace, and every conversation you have about why hens lay so much—that’s how the cycle ends.

This is about redefining the relationship between humans and animals so we value them for who they are, not for what they produce. Breaking the cycle is the most important thing you can do for her and for all the hens who might come after her.

## Factual Response

Hens lay far more than nature intended because of generations of selective breeding. Each egg drains calcium and other nutrients from her body. Over time, this can cause brittle bones, prolapse, egg binding, or reproductive cancers.

Leaving some eggs in the nest can slow production by signaling that her clutch is “complete.” Using dummy eggs can achieve the same effect without risking spoilage.

Because these hens were bred for constant laying, the cycle will continue as long as humans keep replacing them with more of the same breeds. Stopping replacement breeding prevents future hens from enduring the same strain.

Slowing or stopping laying in the hens you already have reduces the physical toll and improves longevity. This is a concrete way to address the biological harm caused by past breeding.

If the eggs must be removed, they can be composted or given to wildlife rehab centers—avoiding human consumption keeps you from reinforcing the idea that animals exist to feed us.

## Practical Response

Breaking the cycle means changing both your actions and the bigger picture:

- **Stop replacement breeding** — Don’t buy chicks from hatcheries; adopt rescues instead.  
- **Reduce laying frequency** — Leave eggs in the nest or use dummy eggs to signal “nest full.”  
- **Shift the purpose** — See chickens as companions, not producers. Care for them whether or not they lay.  
- **Educate others** — Show how “happy backyard chickens” are still the result of selective breeding for human benefit.  
- **End the demand** — Choosing not to eat any eggs, even from your own birds, challenges the cultural norm.

The long-term solution is to shift from egg collection to hen care. Keep them as companions, not as “producers,” and make sure friends, neighbors, and other chicken keepers understand why you don’t eat their eggs.

Adoption instead of buying, reducing laying frequency, and ending demand for “backyard eggs” are practical steps that, over time, help dismantle the system that created overproducing hens in the first place.
