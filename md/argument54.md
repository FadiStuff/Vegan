# Argument 54: "Vegan diets don’t provide enough protein."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Animals aren’t protein sources—they’re individuals. We can get all the protein we need without killing anyone.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Most people easily meet protein needs on a vegan diet with beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
Plant-based protein is everywhere—no need to stress or count grams obsessively once you eat a variety of whole foods.

## Ethical Response

The “protein” in animal flesh comes from the plants those animals ate. We can skip the animal and go straight to the source. It’s not only more efficient—it’s kinder.

Seeing animals as walking protein dispensers ignores their individuality and capacity to suffer. Meeting our protein needs doesn’t justify harming them, especially when alternatives exist.

A vegan diet lets you get plenty of protein without taking anyone’s life. Protein is a nutrient—not a reason for exploitation.

## Factual Response

The average adult needs about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, and most people on a balanced vegan diet exceed that without even trying.

Protein-rich vegan foods include lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, edamame, seitan, quinoa, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and soy milk. Even vegetables like spinach and broccoli contribute to daily totals.

Research shows that vegan athletes can perform at the highest levels without animal protein. The real risk isn’t “not enough protein”—it’s too much saturated fat and cholesterol from animal sources.

## Practical Response

You don’t need to micromanage protein on a vegan diet—just eat a mix of legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetables daily.

A bowl of oatmeal with soy milk and peanut butter, a lentil soup for lunch, and a tofu stir-fry for dinner already covers most people’s needs.

Once you realize how many plant-based foods are protein-rich, the “where do you get your protein?” question becomes less of a concern—and more of a conversation starter.
