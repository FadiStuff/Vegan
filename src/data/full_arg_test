Violence, disease, and territorial aggression are also natural, but we don’t justify them on that basis.\n\nMorality is about choices—especially when we have alternatives. Today, people in developed countries don’t need to eat meat to survive. That makes the killing and exploitation of animals a matter of preference, not necessity. And when our preferences cause suffering and death to sentient beings—animals who feel pain and fear—it becomes an ethical issue.\n\nIf we don’t need to kill to live, then choosing to do so for taste or tradition becomes very hard to justify morally.\n\n---"
