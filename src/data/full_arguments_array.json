But those cases are **not the norm**—they’re niche and small-scale.\n\nGlobally, the cattle industry is one of the largest drivers of deforestation, methane emissions, water consumption, and biodiversity loss. Most cows are not helping grasslands—they're raised in feedlots or on land that was once forest.\n\nThere are plenty of other methods to regenerate soil: cover cropping, composting, no-till farming, agroforestry. These approaches don’t require methane-spewing ruminants to work.\n\nSo while cows *can* play a role in certain systems, they’re far from necessary—and often counterproductive at scale.\n\n---"
