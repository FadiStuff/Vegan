# Argument 1: "Humans are meant to eat meat."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Even if humans *can* eat meat, that doesn’t make it *morally right* to harm animals unnecessarily. In a world where plant-based options exist, continuing to exploit animals isn’t a necessity—it’s a choice.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Our biology shows we’re adaptable omnivores, not obligate carnivores. We can thrive on a well-planned vegan diet, and major health organizations confirm this.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
You don’t need to eat meat to live well. There are affordable, nutritious, and accessible plant-based alternatives for nearly every meat product.

## Ethical Response

The argument that humans are "meant" to eat meat usually appeals to nature: because we evolved to eat meat, it must be morally acceptable. But this is a logical fallacy known as the "appeal to nature"—assuming that what’s natural is automatically good. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s ethical. Violence, disease, and territorial aggression are also natural, but we don’t justify them on that basis.

Morality is about choices—especially when we have alternatives. Today, people in developed countries don’t need to eat meat to survive. That makes the killing and exploitation of animals a matter of preference, not necessity. And when our preferences cause suffering and death to sentient beings—animals who feel pain and fear—it becomes an ethical issue.

If we don’t need to kill to live, then choosing to do so for taste or tradition becomes very hard to justify morally.

## Factual Response

From a biological standpoint, humans are omnivores. That means we *can* eat meat—but it doesn’t mean we *have to*. Our digestive system lacks many traits of true carnivores: we have flat molars for grinding plants, long intestines typical of herbivores, and no claws or sharp teeth for catching prey. We also sweat to cool down rather than pant, which is more like herbivores than carnivores.

Moreover, humans can thrive on plant-based diets. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that “appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.” A balanced vegan diet can support all stages of life—from infancy to adulthood.

So yes, humans evolved to be opportunistic eaters. But that flexibility also means we can choose to stop eating animals—and still be perfectly healthy.

## Practical Response

Even if eating meat was once necessary for survival, that’s no longer the case for most people today. We live in a time where plant-based meats, milks, cheeses, and complete sources of protein are widely available in supermarkets, restaurants, and even fast food chains. Beans, lentils, tofu, seitan, tempeh, nuts, and fortified foods make it easy to meet our nutritional needs without animal products.

You don’t have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Swapping in a veggie burger instead of a beef patty, or choosing oat milk over cow’s milk, are easy and affordable steps. Veganism isn’t about perfection—it’s about reducing harm where we can. And today, it’s more practical than ever.
