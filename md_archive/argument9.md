# Argument 9: "Animals eat better than some humans."

## TL;DRs

**Ethical TL;DR:**  
Using human suffering to justify animal suffering doesn’t solve either problem. If we truly care about feeding people, we should stop funneling food through animals first.

**Factual TL;DR:**  
Animal agriculture consumes massive resources—grains, water, land—that could feed far more humans if used directly. Veganism helps combat hunger, not cause it.

**Practical TL;DR:**  
A plant-based food system is more efficient and equitable. Feeding plants to people instead of animals frees up resources to reduce food insecurity worldwide.

## Ethical Response

Pointing to global hunger to justify eating animals is like saying, “There are starving kids, so I’ll eat two steaks instead of one.” It doesn’t follow—and it doesn’t help.

In fact, animal agriculture worsens hunger. It takes enormous amounts of grain, water, and land to raise animals for food. Those same resources could be used far more efficiently to feed people directly. We’re diverting calories to animals, only to lose most of them in conversion to meat.

If we care about justice, then we should support food systems that nourish the most people with the fewest resources. Veganism does exactly that.

## Factual Response

Globally, over a third of all crops grown are used to feed livestock—not people. That’s food that could go to humans, especially in food-insecure regions. Raising animals for food is incredibly inefficient: it takes about 10 calories of plant feed to produce 1 calorie of meat.

Animal agriculture also consumes vast amounts of freshwater and contributes to land degradation, deforestation, and climate change—all of which disproportionately harm vulnerable human populations.

So when people say, “animals eat better than humans,” they’re accidentally pointing to one of the strongest arguments *for* veganism. A plant-based system feeds more people, more sustainably.

## Practical Response

If you’re worried about food injustice, good. But eating animals doesn’t fix it—it worsens it. Redirecting crops from animal feed to human consumption could help alleviate global hunger, reduce strain on ecosystems, and lower food prices.

A vegan world wouldn’t waste land growing soy for cows. It would use that land to grow food for communities. And no, you don’t need to be a politician to make a difference. Every plate is a vote for a food system that works for more people—and harms fewer beings.

So if the goal is to make sure no one goes hungry, eating plants is the smart move. Eating the middleman (the animal) just adds waste and suffering.
